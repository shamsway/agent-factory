"""Durable routed human handoffs: one public-safe request per terminal escalation generation.

A request is published only once automatic manager recovery is terminal for the latest
escalation (manager `HUMAN`, transport failure, rounds exhausted, or no manager). Its
identity is `<ticket>/<round>`; intent is journaled before the comment, the comment id
after. Uncertain publication is reconciled from GitHub before any retry, and a failed
reconciliation posts nothing. Owners come from the read-only `factory plan route`
producer; a `**Decision owner**` edit by a human wins and is never written back.
