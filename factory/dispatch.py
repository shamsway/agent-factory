"""Stateless AI-factory dispatcher.

One pass per invocation: first the upstream sync merges any new upstream main
commits into the fork's main (host gate, no CI), then the merge stage lands
at most one approved, green, up-to-date factory PR on main; then pick
claimable issues (or --ticket N), run a worker agent in a git worktree, gate,
open a PR, review with the reviewer model, and bounce once. Approval and merge
require the gate, review, durable approval event, CI, and remote PR to agree on
one immutable head containing the current main tip.
All state lives in GitHub and .factory/ on disk.

STANDING_INSTRUCTIONS = """
## Instructions

- Implement exactly what the ticket above asks for; nothing more.
- Use TDD where practical: failing test first, then the fix.
- Commit incrementally with `git commit{commit_flag}`. Stage only files you created or
  edited for the ticket; never `git add -A`, and never commit
  `.factory-prompt.md` or gate reports.
- NEVER use `git stash` — the stash is shared with the user's other worktrees.
- Only push `agent/{n}`. NEVER push, merge into, or fast-forward `{main}`, and
  never close the ticket yourself: the dispatcher opens the PR and the merge
  stage lands it after review and CI.
- Finish by running `{python} -m factory gate --report .factory/gate-report-{n}.md`
  and fixing any failures it reports.
- Last, write `.factory/handoff-{n}.md` (gitignored): what you changed, what is
  still unverified, and what you would do next. The next attempt and the human
  who inherits this ticket read it.
"""

INVESTIGATION_INSTRUCTIONS = """
## Instructions

- This is an investigation, not an implementation. Do NOT modify tracked
  files, commit, or open a PR — the worktree is discarded once this ticket
  finishes; nothing you change here is kept.
- Gather evidence: read logs, run read-only diagnostic commands, inspect
  configuration and infrastructure state relevant to the ticket. Prefer
  read-only commands; if you must run something with side effects to
  reproduce the problem, say so explicitly in the report rather than doing
  it silently.
- Do not attempt to fix anything.
- Last, write `.factory/handoff-{n}.md` (gitignored): what you found, the
  likely cause (or the causes still open), and what you would do next. This
  is posted verbatim as a comment on the issue; a human decides what happens
  next, including whether to file a follow-up implementation ticket.
