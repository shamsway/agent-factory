# agent-factory

A label-driven autonomous ticket pipeline for any GitHub repository. Issues
labelled `ready-for-agent` are claimed by a coding agent in a git worktree,
gated by your own deterministic checks, reviewed by a second model, opened as a
PR, and landed on `main` once the gate, the reviewer, GitHub CI, and freshness
against `main` all agree. Anything the pipeline cannot resolve is handed back
with a `ready-for-human` label and the evidence attached.

It runs on your machine, on a systemd timer, with the agent CLIs you already
have. State is GitHub (labels, comments, PRs) plus a gitignored `.factory/`
directory; the dispatcher itself is stateless and safe to re-run.

```
 needs-triage ──factory triage──▶ ready-for-agent ──factory dispatch──▶ agent/<n> PR ──merge stage──▶ main
                    │                                     │                  │
                    ▼                                     ▼                  ▼
                needs-info                          ready-for-human      factory-approved
```

## Install

Two ways in; both end with the same `factory` CLI on your machine.

**Have your coding agent do it:** install the skill and ask the agent to set up
the factory in your repo. The skill installs the CLI if it is missing, writes
the config from your CI, and runs the doctor.

```sh
npx skills add mikeroysoft/agent-factory
```

**Or by hand.** Linux, Python ≥ 3.11, `git`, `gh` (authenticated with push access), and:

- a **worker** agent CLI that accepts a prompt file and works in a directory
  (default `omp -p`; `droid`, `codex exec`, `claude -p`, … work the same way)
- a **reviewer** CLI that answers a prompt on stdout (default `codex exec`)
- optionally, an OpenAI-compatible local model for triage (Ollama, vLLM,
  llama.cpp, LM Studio)

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/mikeroySoft/agent-factory   # or: pipx install ...
```

No Python dependencies.

## Set up a repository

```sh
cd your-repo
factory init            # .factory.toml, .gitignore, issue template, labels
$EDITOR .factory.toml   # put your real test/lint commands in [[gate.check]]
git add .factory.toml .gitignore .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/agent_task.md && git commit
factory doctor          # tools, auth, remotes, model endpoint
factory install --dashboard   # systemd user timer every 10 min + dashboard on :8765
```

Then file an issue with the **Agent task** template (Scope / Touches / Exit
gate / Out of scope). It gets `needs-triage`; the next pass triages it; if it is
fully specified it becomes `ready-for-agent` and is picked up.

For a fork that tracks an upstream, set `[repo].upstream = "upstream"` and the
dispatcher merges new upstream commits into your `main` (gated) before each
merge stage.

## Commands

| Command | What one invocation does |
|---|---|
| `factory triage` | Labels every `needs-triage` issue via the local model: `ready-for-agent` (with an agent brief), `needs-info` (with the question), `ready-for-human`, or a `wontfix` proposal comment. `--dry-run`, `--issue N`, `--replay a,b,c`. |
| `factory dispatch` | One stateless pass: upstream sync → merge stage (at most one PR) → claim up to `max_active` tickets → worker → gate → PR → review → up to `review_rounds` bounces. `ready-for-investigation` tickets take a shorter path instead: one worker pass, findings posted as a comment, routed to `ready-for-human`. `--ticket N` forces one issue; `--dry-run` prints the plan. |
| `factory apply` | No-op unless `[apply].enabled = true`. One stateless pass: finds merged, not-yet-applied tickets, checks out the merge commit fresh, re-runs the tf-plan-safety check against a fresh `terraform plan`, and applies using `[apply].env` credentials — never the dispatcher's. `--dry-run`. |
| `factory gate` | Runs the deterministic gate in the current worktree and writes a Markdown report. Workers run it themselves; the dispatcher re-runs it as the evidence of record. |
| `factory stats` | Ticket table: attempts, review rounds, hours to merge. `--json`. |
| `factory learn` | Reads the last N finished tickets' event trail, failing-attempt log tails, reviewer findings, and escalation reasons; asks the local model for ≤10 repo-specific lessons; writes `.factory-lessons.md` (you commit it). Every worker prompt carries it. `--dry-run`, `--last N`. |
| `factory dashboard` | Local ops UI: tickets by stage, in-flight phase, gate reports, worker logs, journal heartbeat, upstream drift, and an action list with one-click answers. `--host 0.0.0.0` exposes it (and its mutating `/api/act`) to your network. |
| `factory doctor` / `init` / `install` | Onboarding, above. |

Every command reads `.factory.toml` from the main checkout, even when run
inside one of its worktrees.

## How a ticket moves

1. **Triage.** A deterministic lint rejects bodies under 80 characters or
   without acceptance criteria (`needs-info` with a specific question) —
   unless the issue carries `kind/ops`, which exempts it from the
   acceptance-criteria check (an incident report has no done-condition
   yet). The model then decides between the five labels; `wontfix` is only
   ever proposed. `ready-for-investigation` tickets skip straight to a
   shorter path: one worker pass gathers evidence and posts a findings
   report as a comment — no gate, no PR, no review — then the ticket routes
   to `ready-for-human` for a person to decide what happens next.
2. **Claim.** The dispatcher re-reads the issue (search-backed listings lag),
   assigns itself, takes a per-ticket `flock`, and creates the worktree
   `.factory/wt-<n>` on branch `agent/<n>`.
3. **Work.** The worker gets the issue, its comments, standing instructions
   (commit incrementally, never touch `main`, never `git stash`, finish with
   `factory gate`), and — on retries — the previous gate report or the
   reviewer's findings. Up to `max_attempts` rounds within `budget_min`.
4. **Gate.** `conflict-markers`, your `[[gate.check]]` list in order, then a
   `leak-scan` of added lines against a regex. A check is arbitrary argv —
   a live-system health probe or a `terraform plan` safety check work the
   same as a test command — with an optional per-check `timeout` override.
   Checks marked `exclusive` serialise on a host-wide lock (one GPU, many
   worktrees). Every check has a timeout; a wedged check fails instead of
   holding the lock.
5. **Review.** The reviewer sees the diff, the issue, and the gate report;
   every finding must cite `path:line`; it ends with `VERDICT: APPROVE` or
   `VERDICT: REVISE`. Each `REVISE` goes back to the worker with the findings
   (re-gate, push, re-review), up to `review_rounds` times; then it escalates.
   `APPROVE` adds the `factory-approved` label — durable evidence on the PR,
   not in memory.
6. **Merge stage** (start of the next pass). One PR per pass, requiring all
   four: gate PASS in the PR body, `factory-approved`, green GitHub checks
   (fail-closed on missing or unparsable checks), and a head that already
   contains the current `main` tip. Behind `main` → rebase, re-gate on this
   host, force-push, merge next pass. Red CI → label removed, escalated once
   with the failing check names. A human blocks any merge by requesting
   changes on the PR. With `[apply].enabled = true`, merging additionally
   requires a genuine human GitHub review approval — the merge itself is
   then the trigger `factory apply` waits for (below).
7. **Escalation.** Budget exceeded, gate failed thrice, second `REVISE`,
   nothing to PR, rebase conflict, red CI: the issue gets `ready-for-human`,
   loses the assignee and `ready-for-agent`, and receives a comment with the
   reason and the worker log path. The worktree is kept for forensics.

## Configuration

`.factory.toml` at the repository root; every key is optional. The template
written by `factory init` documents them all. The ones you will actually set:

```toml
[repo]
# upstream = "upstream"          # fork workflow: sync upstream main each pass

[dispatch]
review_rounds = 1                # REVISE -> worker -> re-review cycles
# cost_pattern = 'Total cost:\s*\$([0-9.]+)'   # $ from the worker log (Claude Code prints this)

[workers]                        # ticket label -> argv; {prompt} file, {cwd} worktree
default = ["omp", "-p", "--cwd", "{cwd}", "@{prompt}"]
chore   = ["droid", "exec", "-f", "{prompt}", "--auto", "medium", "--cwd", "{cwd}"]

[review]
command = ["codex", "exec", "{prompt}"]   # {prompt} = review prompt text

[gate]
timeout = 1200
lock = "/tmp/agent-factory.lock"

[[gate.check]]
name = "lint"
run = ["cargo", "clippy", "--workspace", "--all-targets", "--", "-D", "warnings"]
exclusive = true

[[gate.check]]
name = "tests"
run = ["cargo", "test", "--workspace"]
exclusive = true

[leak_scan]
pattern = "internal|confidential|proprietary|private|jira|confluence|\\.corp|\\.internal"

[triage]
url = "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1/chat/completions"
model = "qwen3:30b"
```

Labels (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`,
`factory-approved`, `chore`) and the `agent/<n>` branch scheme are fixed
conventions; `factory init` creates the labels.

## Operating it

- **Dashboard** (`factory dashboard`): the *actions* list is the inbox —
  escalations, `needs-info` questions, wontfix proposals, parked upstream
  syncs, a dead timer — each with the exact command or a button.
- **Spend**: the *Spend* KPI and each ticket's attempts tab total worker+gate
  wall clock from `events.jsonl`, plus dollars when `cost_pattern` matches
  your worker's log.
- **Learning loop**: after a batch of tickets, `factory learn --dry-run`,
  read the proposed lessons, then `factory learn` and commit
  `.factory-lessons.md`. Workers see it on every ticket. The eval signal is the
  dashboard's *first-gate pass* and *bounce rate* KPIs moving after the change;
  edit or delete lessons that don't earn their keep.
- **Audit trail**: `.factory/events.jsonl` — one row per stage transition
  (`claimed`, `attempt` with worker exit/gate result/seconds, `pr-opened`,
  `review` verdict, `approved`, `refreshed`, `merged`, `escalate` with reason,
  `upstream-sync`). `jq 'select(.ticket==42)' .factory/events.jsonl` is a
  ticket's whole history without a GitHub call.
- **Handoff notes**: each worker attempt ends by writing
  `.factory/wt-<n>/.factory/handoff-<n>.md` (what changed, what is unverified,
  what next). The next attempt gets it in its prompt; an escalation quotes it
  in the issue comment.
- **Logs**: `.factory/logs/<n>-attempt-<k>.log` per worker round;
  `.factory/wt-<n>/.factory/gate-report-<n>.md` per gate;
  `journalctl --user -u factory-<repo>.service` for dispatcher passes.
- **Re-run one ticket by hand**: `factory dispatch --ticket N` (bypasses the
  frontier and its label checks; respects the in-flight lock).
- **Stop everything**: `systemctl --user disable --now factory-<repo>.timer`.
  In-flight tickets finish their current pass; nothing new is claimed.
- **Tear down a ticket**: remove the worktree (`git worktree remove --force
  .factory/wt-<n>`), delete `agent/<n>`, and re-label the issue.
- **Deployments & recovery**: for repositories using `factory apply`, see
  [docs/deployment-lifecycle.md](docs/deployment-lifecycle.md) for multi-target
  configuration, backend serialization, crash recovery, and operator reconciliation.

## Agent skill

`skills/agent-factory/SKILL.md` teaches a coding agent to install the factory
in a repo, write tickets it can actually work, and diagnose escalations:

```sh
npx skills add mikeroysoft/agent-factory
```

## Architecture

`agent_factory/architecture.html` (served by the dashboard at `/atlas`) shows
the system and the ticket lifecycle. Modules map 1:1 to commands:
`triage.py`, `dispatch.py`, `gate.py`, `stats.py`, `dashboard.py`,
`onboard.py`, with `config.py` as the single source of every repo-specific
value.
