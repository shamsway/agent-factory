# factory

A label-driven autonomous ticket pipeline for any GitHub repository. Issues
labelled `ready-for-agent` are claimed by a coding agent in a git worktree,
gated by your own deterministic checks, reviewed by a second model, opened as a
PR, and landed on `main` once the gate, the reviewer, GitHub CI, and freshness
against `main` all agree. Anything the pipeline cannot resolve is handed back
with a `ready-for-human` label and the evidence attached.

It runs on your machine, on a systemd timer, with the agent CLIs you already
have. State is GitHub (labels, comments, PRs) plus a gitignored `.factory/`
directory; the dispatcher itself is stateless and safe to re-run.

```
 needs-triage ──factory triage──▶ ready-for-agent ──factory dispatch──▶ agent/<n> PR ──merge stage──▶ main
                    │                                     │                  │
                    ▼                                     ▼                  ▼

```

## Install

Two ways in; both end with the same `factory` CLI on your machine.

**Have your coding agent do it:** install the skill and ask the agent to set up
the factory in your repo. The skill installs the CLI if it is missing, writes
the config from your CI, and runs the doctor.

```sh
npx skills add mikeroysoft/factory
```

**Or by hand.** Linux, Python ≥ 3.11, `git`, `gh` (authenticated with push access), and:

- a **worker** agent CLI that accepts a prompt file and works in a directory
  (default `omp -p`; `droid`, `codex exec`, `claude -p`, … work the same way)
- optionally, a **manager** agent CLI that accepts a prompt file and works in a directory
- a **reviewer** CLI that answers an inline prompt on stdout (default `omp -p --model anthropic/claude-fable-5-1`; `codex exec` works the same way)
- optionally, an OpenAI-compatible local model for triage (Ollama, vLLM,
  llama.cpp, LM Studio)

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/mikeroySoft/factory@stable   # stable: released channel
uv tool install git+https://github.com/mikeroySoft/factory@main     # latest: tip of main
uv tool install git+https://github.com/mikeroySoft/factory@v0.3.5   # a specific release
```

`pipx install` and `pip install --user` take the same URLs. The repository's
default branch is `main`, so a bare URL installs development code. Select
`@stable` explicitly for the released channel or a version tag for a fixed release;
see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). TOMLKit is installed automatically for comment-preserving settings updates.

## Set up a repository

```sh
cd your-repo
factory init            # .factory.toml, .gitignore, issue template, labels
$EDITOR .factory.toml   # put your real test/lint commands in [[gate.check]]
git add .factory.toml .gitignore .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE && git commit
factory doctor          # tools, auth, remotes, model endpoint, dashboard port ownership
factory install --dashboard   # systemd user timer every 10 min + dashboard on :8765
```

`doctor` checks the configured dashboard bind address and port; `install --dashboard`
refuses a foreign or unidentified holder before writing units. Each factory needs
its own `[repo."owner/name".dashboard] port` in the host config. The preflight cannot
reserve the port until systemd starts the service: a later bind failure exits 1
with a one-line diagnostic, and the existing systemd restart policy still applies.

`factory doctor --json` includes a `fix` object on actionable drift rows only:
`kind: patch` carries an advisory `diff` from the issue template to the shipped
version; `kind: relocate` lists host-setting key paths and destination tables;
`kind: keys` lists unknown configuration keys with their 1-based source lines.
Relocation payloads omit values unless explicitly requested with
`factory doctor --json --reveal-fix`, which adds a `toml` string containing the
values under their destination host tables. Treat that output as sensitive.
Doctor never applies these repairs; text output is unchanged.

Generated triage, dispatch and dashboard services use the interpreter selected by
host-owned, optional `[install].python`, or `sys.executable` (the interpreter running
`factory install`) when unset, followed by `-P -m factory`. Set
`python = "/path/to/venv/bin/python"` under `[defaults.install]` or
`[repo."owner/name".install]`; a committed `[install]` remains a host-setting warning.
The selected path preserves symlink identity and is rendered as one systemd
argument: control characters are rejected, and backslash, quote, `$` and `%` are
escaped so systemd executes the validated literal path.

For a configured interpreter, `doctor` and a real `install` check the path and run
a 10-second probe from the repository working directory. Validation snapshots the
user manager environment read-only with `systemctl --user show-environment`,
parses its assignments, applies the PATH rendered into units, then overlays
`[install].env`. Failures stop installation before any mutation.
The probe loads all three service commands and reports the loaded Factory version
and location. It checks every loaded service module origin (`factory`,
`factory.cli`, `factory.triage`, `factory.dispatch` and `factory.dashboard`), with
the selected interpreter's `purelib`/`platlib` context as appropriate, rejecting
lexical origins under the repository root (`cfg.root`) unless within a selected
package root.
`-P` only prevents Python from automatically prepending the working directory:
`PYTHONPATH` and other explicit import sources still apply and remain
operator-controlled. Factory neither provisions the environment nor requires its
version to match the installer. `install --print` only renders the units; like its
other operational preflights, interpreter validation runs only for a real install.

Then file an issue with the **Agent task** template (Scope / Touches / Exit
gate / Out of scope). It gets `needs-triage`; the next pass triages it; if it is
fully specified it becomes `ready-for-agent` and is picked up.

For shared, longer-lived plans, file an issue with the **Initiative** template
(Status / Outcome / Owner / Areas / Boundaries / Plan / Open decisions /
Success evidence / Implementation links). It gets only `initiative`, never
`needs-triage`; discussion and edits on the issue are the collaboration
surface, and `factory plan` reads it. Status (`proposed`, `shaping`, `ready`,
`underway`, `delivered`) and Owner are declared facts, never inferred from
child closure and not grants of permission. The `initiative` label is an
unconditional execution guard read fresh at every boundary: triage never
promotes an initiative (no model call), the dispatcher never claims one even
with `--ticket`, the manager never assesses or manages one, and the merge stage
never merges an `agent/<n>` PR whose ticket #n is an initiative. Refusals are
logged (also in `--dry-run`) and mutate nothing: no labels, assignees, comments
or escalation packets. A stale frontier row cannot bypass the fresh read.

### Shared roadmap and owner attention

The dashboard's **Roadmap** view and the read-only FM use the same Python
initiative, decision-routing and immutable-binding producers. The roadmap shows
declared Outcome and stage, implementation evidence, open decisions, blockers,
and accepted-versus-observed revision drift. These are different kinds of
evidence: a declared `delivered` stage, closed child ticket, or merged PR does
not establish delivery. Outcome success still requires owner-confirmed evidence;
the reader does not authenticate an issue-body declaration as that confirmation.
The shared list uses the dashboard's existing 15-second cache; Refresh requests
new evidence. Targeted initiative reads are collected directly.

The owner/team selector filters **questions**, not the canonical plans or their
revisions. It is not login, assignment, permission, or a notification receipt.
Selected owners, candidates, invalid declarations and unknown ownership retain
the routing producer's meaning. Organization context validation does not prove
team membership or notification delivery. Unknown owners remain visible as an
attention gap rather than an empty work list.

Coverage is explicit: failed, partial and incomplete reads are not successful
empty results. A ticket without an accepted baseline has unknown drift, not
“unchanged” drift. Complete authoritative content determines revision identity,
including edits beyond the 4,000-character display projection. Retained accepted
evidence remains readable when the live initiative is unavailable; later edits
never amend an admitted execution snapshot.

An assigned ticket with evidence of no active execution is shown as non-runnable
human takeover, not as invisible queue starvation. The exception is Factory's own
claim: a journaled `claimed`/`pr-opened` receipt with no later `escalate` marks the
ticket as held in Factory's review/merge pipeline, not a takeover. Incomplete runtime
evidence instead leaves execution responsibility unknown and asks for human verification.
Changing the attention filter or replying to a question cannot release it. Humans
must arrange any retry through the existing reviewed ticket/assignment/intake workflow.

The roadmap adds no mutation controls or new model call. Full accepted snapshots
are kept out of shared briefing duplication; use a targeted initiative/drift
read for revision evidence. Discussion and session-only FM proposals remain proposals,
not accepted shared policy. The one-runner boundary and all existing holds remain
in force. This implementation is not the distinct-runner/two-human live acceptance
pilot tracked by programme #52 and issue #59.

### Immutable initiative bindings

An implementation ticket can opt in to an immutable initiative revision with an
`Initiative: #N` declaration and a fenced JSON object under either
`**Plan baseline**` or `## Plan baseline`. The baseline object has
`schema_version: 1`, the integer `initiative`, a `sections` object containing
exactly `Outcome`, `Boundaries`, `Plan`, and `Success evidence`, a `sha256`,
the exact `source_url` (`https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/N`), and a
timezone-bearing `observed_at`. Factory reads the complete initiative body
through the REST issue endpoint, not the bounded display projection.

For the digest, each relevant section first converts CRLF and CR line endings
to LF and strips whitespace only at the section edges; internal whitespace is
retained. Factory then hashes the UTF-8 encoding of
`json.dumps(sections, sort_keys=True, ensure_ascii=False, separators=(",", ":"))`
with SHA-256. The same parser and normalization drive baseline validation and
later drift, so changes beyond display limits cannot look unchanged. Changes
inside canonical non-scope sections (such as Status, Owner and Open decisions),
issue metadata, and GitHub discussion comments do not change this digest.
Only the initiative template's named headings delimit sections; free-form
subheadings within a relevant section remain part of that section and its digest.

Admission fails closed with a specific reason when a linked ticket has a
missing, malformed, ambiguous, mismatched, incomplete, deleted, or inaccessible
binding or source. A successful admission journals a schema-1 `plan-bound`
event with the accepted baseline and the ticket's complete title, body, and
comments. That whole accepted ticket snapshot remains the human-approved
execution contract: every retry reuses it and cannot adopt later ticket-body or
initiative revisions. A previously bound ticket cannot downgrade itself by
removing the link or baseline. Legacy tickets that have never declared an
initiative remain unchanged.
A later explicit admission records a new complete ticket snapshot without
rewriting the evidence or contract of earlier attempts.
Briefing event summaries retain revision metadata rather than duplicating the
full snapshot, so later attempts, escalations and handoff evidence keep their
context budget. The complete accepted evidence remains in the journal.

`factory plan baseline N` is read-only and returns a proposed object under the
schema-1 response's top-level `baseline` key. `factory plan drift TICKET` is
also read-only: it loads the latest accepted `plan-bound` evidence before
querying the live initiative and writes `status`, `baseline`, `observed`,
`changed_sections`, `proposed_question`, and `attribution` under the top-level
`drift` key. Status is `unchanged`, `changed`, or `unavailable`; changed results
name only the relevant sections, while unavailable results retain the accepted
snapshot and set `observed` to null. Attribution is always `unknown`, never
guessed from the current issue author when plan history is unavailable.

To rebaseline, generate a fresh proposal after the initiative edit, have a
human review and replace the ticket's fenced baseline, then send that ticket
through the ordinary intake workflow. Comments are discussion only: Factory
has no comment command that rebaselines or expands execution authority. Once a
ticket is bound, wholly unlinked work belongs in a new ticket. A currently
running contract never changes in place.

Manager `REWRITE` may retain existing behavior only when it preserves the
accepted Initiative link and baseline exactly. `SPLIT` children inherit that
same binding; Factory validates the complete live source before creating any
child. A child of an unlinked parent may declare its own binding, but it must
pass the same validation. Any missing, invalid, drifted, or unavailable source
rejects the whole split before the first child reaches `needs-triage`; the
manager cannot supply a replacement baseline.
Preserving the binding allows the existing rewrite-and-requeue behavior; a
later admission records its own full ticket snapshot and leaves prior
`plan-bound` evidence intact.

GitHub issue-body writes remain last-write-wins. Refresh the issue immediately
before editing and use discussion to propose revisions first. The pinned
snapshot protects admitted execution; it is not concurrency control for
simultaneous human edits.

For a fork that tracks an upstream, set `[repo].upstream = "upstream"` and the
dispatcher merges new upstream commits into your `main` (gated) before each
merge stage.

## Commands

| Command | What one invocation does |
|---|---|
| `factory triage` | Labels every `needs-triage` issue via the local model: `ready-for-agent` (with an agent brief), `needs-info` (with the question), `ready-for-human`, or a `wontfix` proposal comment. `--dry-run`, `--issue N`, `--replay a,b,c`. |
| `factory dispatch` | One stateless pass: upstream sync → merge stage (at most one PR) → review-only PR intake → manager → claim up to `max_active` tickets → worker → gate → PR → review → up to `review_rounds` bounces. `ready-for-investigation` tickets take a shorter path instead: one worker pass, findings posted as a comment, routed to `ready-for-human`. `--ticket N` forces one issue; `--dry-run` prints the plan. |
| `factory manage` | First recommends directions for `needs-review` PRs, then `needs-viability` issues; then resolves untouched `ready-for-human` escalation packets within `[manager].rounds`; finally publishes one routed human handoff request per escalation whose automatic recovery is terminal (also without a manager). `--dry-run` lists eligible requests without inference or writes. |
| `factory gate` | Runs the deterministic gate in the current worktree and writes a Markdown report. Workers run it themselves; the dispatcher re-runs it as the evidence of record. |
| `factory stats` | Ticket table: attempts, review rounds, hours to merge, escalation count, resolver attribution, minutes in `ready-for-human`, and re-queues. Reads GitHub plus existing `events.jsonl`. `--by-worker` reads only events and shows every configured worker label: first-attempt gate pass rate, all attempts (including review bounces), and known cost. Attribution uses claim labels with current worker precedence; unclaimed attempts are excluded, missing rates/cost are `n/a`. The dashboard Ops view shows the same worker metrics. `--json`. |
| `factory learn` | Reads the last N finished tickets' event trail, failing-attempt log tails, reviewer findings, and escalation reasons; asks the local model for ≤10 repo-specific lessons; writes `.factory-lessons.md` (you commit it). Every worker prompt carries it. `--dry-run`, `--last N`. |
| `factory dashboard` | Local ops UI: Inbox, Ops, a dedicated read-only Factory Manager Chat with browser-local history, Codebase history, and Atlas; tickets by stage, in-flight phase, gate reports, worker logs, journal heartbeat, and upstream drift. `--json` prints the existing snapshot, including independent executions and local interruption reconciliation. `--host 0.0.0.0` exposes it, its mutating `/api/act`, and local settings writes to your network. |
| `factory dashboard --runtime-json` | One bounded schema 1 runtime observation using only local read-only evidence; no GitHub, model probe, journal append, lock acquisition, or state creation. Partial source failures remain structured JSON. See [runtime contract](#bounded-runtime-json-schema-1). |
| `factory evidence --root /path/to/main-checkout` | One explicit-repository schema 1 JSON read: compact cases, selected evidence, workflow/file/PR/CI investigations, or capabilities. Read-only GitHub GETs and F03 local evidence; no model, action execution, or state writes. See [evidence contract](#bounded-project-evidence-json-schema-1). |
| `factory plan list` / `factory plan inspect N` | Read-only schema 1 JSON over `initiative` issues: declared status/owner, parsed sections, `#N` implementation links (`inspect` also fetches each linked issue's title/state), per-issue `malformed` + `problems` (missing/invalid declared facts, sections cut at 4,000 characters, links beyond the first 20), cited sources with `observed_at`. `list` reads at most 3 pages of 100 and keeps malformed initiatives flagged per row (exit 0); a failed page, or a malformed initiative under `inspect`, yields `coverage.status: partial` and exit 1, never a mutation. |
| `factory plan route N --reason <requirements\|implementation\|ci\|unknown> [--path P]... --json` | Read-only schema 1 JSON naming the human who owns a decision on ticket N; nothing is assigned, labelled or commented. JSON is also the default when `--json` is omitted. Priority: a `**Decision owner**` section in the ticket body (human override, wins on every recomputation), the canonical `Initiative: #N` (or legacy `Programme: #N`) initiative's Owner, or the initiative's own Owner when routing that initiative (requirements only), `[collaboration.reasons]`, `[collaboration.components]` exact repo-relative path prefixes against the given `--path`s (implementation only; `src/auth` matches `src/auth/x.py`, never `src/authentication/`), then `[collaboration].fallback`. `route.status` is `selected`, `candidates` (paths span prefixes with different owners), `unassigned` (reason `unknown`, no `--path` for implementation, or nothing configured) or `invalid` (malformed declared owner; `@org/team` on a user-owned repository). `route.revision` ties the answer to the `.factory.toml` commit and issue `updated_at`; `route.provenance` lists every step. Owner syntax is checked, membership is not: an unreadable repository record leaves `verification: unknown`. Without a `[collaboration]` section only ticket sources apply. |
| `factory plan baseline N` / `factory plan drift TICKET` | Read-only schema 1 JSON for proposing a complete immutable initiative baseline or comparing a ticket's latest accepted baseline with the live complete source. Results are under top-level `baseline` or `drift`; neither command edits issues, rebaselines work, or grants execution authority. |
| `factory doctor` / `init` / `install` | Onboarding, above. |

Routing distinguishes absent optional information from invalid declarations. A missing
ticket `Decision owner` section permits fallback; an empty or malformed section stops
with `invalid`. A missing initiative `Owner` section permits configured requirements
ownership and fallback, but an explicitly empty or malformed Owner stops routing.
On user-owned repositories, mixed team/login destinations remain invalid with no
selection; provenance retains the original destinations and rejected teams for
diagnosis. Unavailable verification remains unknown, never authorization.
`collaboration.reasons.unknown` and component prefixes that normalize to the same
key are configuration errors; `--reason unknown` remains a valid non-guessing request.

Every command reads `.factory.toml` from the main checkout, even when run
inside one of its worktrees.

Worker and manager commands receive `{prompt}` as a prompt-file path and `{cwd}`
as the worktree (or repository root); reviewers receive `{prompt}` as inline
text. OMP loads a prompt file only when it is prefixed with `@`, so use
`@{prompt}`: bare `omp {prompt}` passes the path as prompt text. Factory rejects
that bare argument for manager commands, not worker commands.
Keep `{cwd}` in worker and manager commands, and configure the manager CLI in
read-only/no-tools mode: the prompt prohibits file edits, but an arbitrary
configured executable is trusted, not sandboxed by factory. The manager reads
the packet, `.factory-lessons.md`, and optional `.factory/manager/notes.md`.
Its last `DECISION:` header
selects `RETRY`, `REWRITE`, `SPLIT`, `ROUTE`, `FIX`, or `HUMAN`, followed by the decision
body. RETRY/HUMAN use plain text; REWRITE uses the complete replacement issue body.
SPLIT uses a JSON array of `{title, body, blocked_by}` children, with `blocked_by`
containing 1-based indexes of earlier children. ROUTE uses `{add, remove, guidance}`,
with label arrays restricted to configured worker labels (not `default`).
Workers can use either the legacy argv array or a `[workers.<label>]` table with
`command = [...]` and optional `when = "..."`. The prompt lists routable labels
with their `when` rules; neither ROUTE nor FIX accepts unlisted labels.
FIX uses `{"worker":"ci-fix","guidance":"..."}` to run exactly one selected worker
round in the kept `agent/<n>` worktree for its open PR, ignoring other ticket
labels and refusing a kept head that no longer matches the remote PR. It passes
guidance and the escalation packet to the worker, re-gates, pushes only on a
gate PASS bound to the resulting commit, and re-reviews that
same commit. Only a zero-exit, well-formed fresh APPROVE whose remote PR head
still matches restores `factory-approved`; failure stays with the human. FIX
does not merge or requeue the issue.
The template includes opt-in `ci-fix` and `conflict` profiles for a
human to apply in host config; the manager cannot add profiles or edit config.
Code validates the output, records a `manage` event before GitHub mutations, and
leaves malformed decisions with a prefixed HUMAN diagnosis. Split children enter
`needs-triage`; the parent keeps `ready-for-human` with child blocker lines.
For `REWRITE` and `SPLIT`, Factory refreshes the issue body immediately before
applying the decision. A linked rewrite must preserve its accepted Initiative
and Plan baseline exactly. Bound split children inherit that baseline, and all
linked children are validated against the complete live initiative before the
first issue is created. A validation failure consumes the recorded manager
round, creates no intake-ready child, and leaves the parent with the human.
A trailing fenced `notes` block replaces `.factory/manager/notes.md`
(gitignored, never committed, carried into every later manager prompt). The block
is optional; code refuses an empty or over-16 KB replacement, keeps the existing
file, and records the outcome in the `manage` event's `notes` field
(`written`, `empty_rejected`, `oversize_rejected`, or null when no block was sent).
Manager executions and ticket-lock waits use the lifecycle journal. If a GitHub
mutation fails, the execution records a terminal failure and the ticket remains
with the human; other tickets can proceed. The consumed round is not replayed,
because a partial rewrite or split may already have changed GitHub.

### Routed human handoffs

Once automatic recovery for an escalation is terminal — the manager returned `HUMAN`,
its command could not run (an explicit *unable to diagnose*, never a fabricated
diagnosis), `manager.rounds` is exhausted, no manager is configured, or the escalation
loop can never act again (its decision could not be applied to GitHub, its packet is
gone, or its escalation comment was never receipted so takeover detection cannot clear
it, as for escalations recorded before this version) — `factory manage`
publishes **one** request comment for that escalation generation (`<ticket>/<round>`):
a concrete question, bounded public links (PR, the recorded escalation and manager
comments), a proposed next step, the routed owner or candidates, and the step-by-step
routing rationale from `factory plan route` (reason `ci` for CI failures, otherwise
`implementation` with the PR's changed paths). Runner-local paths, packets and logs
never reach GitHub. While recovery is still eligible nothing is posted; routing stays
advisory (`factory plan route N`).
The terminal handoff phase is still attempted if an earlier manager phase fails.
That failure remains an error: publishing a handoff does not authorize the dispatcher
to continue scheduling new work.

The request `@mention`s a GitHub login on the initial handoff and again only when the
owner actually changes (a human sets or edits `**Decision owner**` in the issue body,
which wins on every later read and is never written back). Teams are mentioned only on a
verified organization repository; unassigned, invalid or unavailable routing states the
gap instead. Nobody is assigned. Publication is intent-then-receipt in
`.factory/events.jsonl` (`handoff` row before the comment, `comment` row with the
comment id after); a crash or failed `gh` between the two is reconciled from the issue
timeline before any retry, and when that lookup fails nothing is posted. GitHub
delivery of a mention is not asserted.
Explanatory text escapes mention syntax, including rejected destinations, routing
provenance and previous owners; only the current validated owner or candidates receive
native mentions.

Human-takeover detection uses only the factory's own recorded comment ids: the
escalation comment, manager comments and handoff requests are journaled as `comment`
receipts and ignored; any other comment, label, assignee, body edit, or an edit to a
recorded comment counts as human activity and stops the manager. Text prefixes are
never trusted. Without the current escalation's recorded comment on the timeline,
the manager fails closed: even a failed escalation post leads to a routed handoff,
not an exemption for later human label or assignee changes. A handoff receipt cannot
substitute for the missing escalation receipt on a later pass.
Manager `CLOSE` comments are posted explicitly before closing their respective PR
or issue, with each receipt scoped to the timeline that owns the comment. A partial
close failure does not replay the consumed manager decision.
A reply is context for humans, not a retry, approval or merge command;
use the documented labels for that.

### Opt-in viability recommendations

Viability asks **should we pursue this direction?**, before spending effort on
specification or code review. With `[manager].command` configured, opt in explicitly:

```bash
factory init --labels-only  # provisions the vocabulary on an existing installation
gh pr edit N --add-label needs-review
gh issue edit N --add-label needs-viability
factory manage --dry-run
factory manage
```

The manager handles `needs-review` PRs **before** `needs-viability` issues, both
before escalation management. The existing dispatch pass invokes the same stage;
there is no unlabeled-backlog sweep, new service, or separate model transport.
Held requests (`factory-held`), closed targets, targets with conflicting pipeline
labels, and locked targets are skipped. An unconfigured manager leaves labels alone.

Each recommendation is an issue/PR comment prefixed `Factory manager:`, with
reasoning, source citations, and one final machine-readable line:
`VERDICT: BUILD`, `VERDICT: DONT_BUILD`, or `VERDICT: DEFER`.

| Target / verdict | Label transition and authority |
|---|---|
| Issue / BUILD | Remove `needs-viability`, add `needs-triage` for deeper investigation. Never directly queue implementation; a vague idea need not already pass triage's specification checks. |
| Issue / DONT_BUILD or DEFER | Remove `needs-viability`; leave open, propose only. No `wontfix`, closure, or replacement workflow label. A human decides whether to close, defer, or overrule. |
| PR / any verdict | Retain `needs-review`; recommend only, even BUILD. Dispatch independently runs the SHA-bound quality review before this stage; viability adds no handoff label and never approves, requests changes, merges, or closes PRs. |

`needs-review` is shared opt-in, not a viability-owned completion marker. Viability
records each label-add request independently of dispatch's `(PR, head SHA)`
review-intake record. Its advisory verdict neither completes nor vetoes review.
Viability can assess drafts; dispatch discovers only open, non-draft PRs and also accepts
a pending review request for the authenticated factory account. That alternative
review opt-in does not opt a PR into viability.

The model uses the existing evidence/briefing source helpers: bounded target
description/comments, recent issues and PRs (not an exhaustive duplicate search),
selected repository code and README/roadmap context, lessons and manager notes.
The bundle caps source text at 64,000 bytes / 40 sources (20,000 per source),
with smaller prefixes for target bodies, summaries, and files. It samples 12
recent PRs and 12 issue-endpoint rows across all states, the target's latest
comment page (at most 12 entries), up to three tracked documents and three
code files, and at most 30 PR changed-file summaries without diff patches.
Sources name their coverage limits; missing evidence is unknown, not absence.
The prompt asks for value, overlap, roadmap fit, cost/risk estimates, and the
smallest useful investigation, with citations separating facts from estimates.
Malformed, uncited, unknown-citation, or failed model output becomes a diagnostic
DEFER; it cannot queue work.

Idempotency is per **label-add timeline event**, independent of escalation rounds.
Under the existing per-ticket lock, the manager rechecks the target (including
PR head) and timeline after inference; intervening human changes leave it untouched.
It records the verdict and full proposed comment in `.factory/events.jsonl`
(`event: viability`) **before** any GitHub mutation, then posts and consumes only
issue triggers. A second pass never repeats that request, even with `needs-review`
still present or after a partial/ambiguous
GitHub failure. In that case inspect the recorded comment and live state before
recovering manually; automatic replay could duplicate an already-posted comment.
Keep the local journal: this is the same single-host at-most-once boundary as
escalation management, not a distributed exactly-once service. To deliberately
reconsider, remove and re-add the opt-in label; body or PR-head edits alone do not
re-arm a recorded viability request.

Human-touch metrics are read-only; no manager behavior is required. A
`ready-for-human` label addition starts an escalation interval; removal ends it
and attributes the resolution to that removal's actor (`User` → human, `Bot` →
factory, absent/other → unknown). Resolver logins are retained. Automation using
a human account is indistinguishable from manual activity under that account.
Open intervals accrue until now, or until closure/merge for finished tickets.
Re-queues count `ready-for-agent` additions after the initial queue entry, with
repeated `claimed` trace records as a fallback. Trace escalation counts likewise
supplement timeline counts without adding the two counts together.
Manager command failures are counted separately as `manager_failures` in stats
JSON and dashboard ticket `human_touch` data, and as `manager failures` in the
stats table. They do not add an escalation or consume another manager round.

The stats footer and dashboard KPIs show escalations in the trailing seven days
and the percentage of attributed resolutions performed by humans; unresolved
and unknown resolutions are excluded from that denominator (`n/a`/`null` when
none are attributed). `factory dashboard --json` exposes
`metrics.escalations_per_week`, `metrics.human_resolved_pct` (0–100), and each
ticket's `human_touch` details. The dashboard retains its existing 100-issue,
100-PR, and 100-timeline-item query limits; stats paginates label timelines.

## How a ticket moves

1. **Triage.** A deterministic lint rejects bodies under 80 characters or
   without acceptance criteria (`needs-info` with a specific question) —
   unless the issue carries `kind/ops`, which exempts it from the
   acceptance-criteria check (an incident report has no done-condition
   yet). The model then decides between the five labels; `wontfix` is only
   ever proposed. `ready-for-investigation` tickets skip straight to a
   shorter path: one worker pass gathers evidence and posts a findings
   report as a comment — no gate, no PR, no review — then the ticket routes
   to `ready-for-human` for a person to decide what happens next.
2. **Claim.** The dispatcher re-reads the issue (search-backed listings lag),
   assigns itself, takes a per-ticket `flock`, and creates the worktree
   `.factory/wt-<n>` on branch `agent/<n>`.
3. **Work.** The worker gets the issue, its comments, standing instructions
   (commit incrementally, never touch `main`, never `git stash`, finish with
   `factory gate`), and — on retries — the previous gate report or the
   reviewer's findings. Up to `max_attempts` rounds within `budget_min`.
4. **Gate.** `conflict-markers`, your `[[gate.check]]` list in order, then a
   `leak-scan` of added lines against a regex. A check is arbitrary argv —
   a live-system health probe or a `terraform plan` safety check work the
   same as a test command — with an optional per-check `timeout` override.
   Checks marked `exclusive` serialise on a host-wide lock (one GPU, many
   worktrees). Every check has a timeout; a wedged check fails instead of
   holding the lock.
5. **Review.** The reviewer runs the diff itself, gets the gate report inline, and
   is told to read issue #N's comments (the triage brief, approved scope changes).
   Every finding cites `path:line`; a required fix also cites an acceptance
   criterion, a documented rule with its source, or a concrete correctness/security
   defect with its trigger and impact — preferences and hypothetical extensibility
   are optional suggestions, never requirements, and a passing gate does not
   excuse a defect it did not detect. Net-new abstractions beyond the brief,
   whether the diff introduced them or the review asks for them, need that same
   justification, but a missing justification alone does not block. Reviews must
   exit zero and end with exactly one final `VERDICT: APPROVE` or
   `VERDICT: REVISE` line; malformed, multiple, non-final, and nonzero-exit
   verdicts fail closed as REVISE. Each `REVISE` sends the findings back to the
   worker, flagged so only the required fixes are binding (re-gate, push,
   re-review), up to `review_rounds` times; then it escalates.
   `APPROVE` adds the `factory-approved` label only while the remote PR still
   points to the exact commit that passed the gate and review. The successful
   label operation and gate/review commit are recorded in `.factory/events.jsonl`.
6. **Merge stage** (start of the next pass). One PR per pass requires green
   GitHub checks, a current-main head, no human requested-changes veto, the
   `factory-approved` label, and a matching successful journal approval whose
   gate, review, approval, and current PR head SHAs are identical. Checks are
   associated with that head and rechecked after evidence evaluation; the PR
   head, target branch, label, and veto are then re-read immediately before
   `gh pr merge --match-head-commit <sha>`. Missing,
   unbound, legacy, or stale approval evidence never merges. Behind `main` →
   refresh, re-gate on this host, force-push, run a fresh independent review,
   post its findings, and either reapprove the resulting head or withdraw the
   label and escalate. Red CI → label removed, escalated once with the failing
   check names.
   Existing behind PRs re-earn bound evidence through that automatic refresh.
   An up-to-date PR carrying a pre-upgrade unbound approval is withdrawn and
   escalated once; use the existing manager `FIX` path to re-run its worker,
   gate, push, and review. Do not hand-edit the journal or fabricate SHA fields.
   PR creation explicitly selects `[repo].main` (default `main`), independently
   of the installed engine channel and GitHub's default branch. Approval and merge
   eligibility require that same PR target; existing wrong-target PRs are left
   untouched for operator review. Missing target evidence also fails closed.
   `--match-head-commit` atomically guards the head, not the target branch or a
   late human veto. Protect release branches on GitHub; the final reads alone
   cannot prevent a retarget after the last check.
7. **Escalation.** Budget exceeded, gate failed thrice, second `REVISE`,
   nothing to PR, rebase conflict, red CI: the issue gets `ready-for-human`,
   loses the assignee and `ready-for-agent`, and receives a comment with the
   reason and the worker log path (its comment id is journaled). The worktree
   is kept for forensics. When no automatic manager recovery remains, one routed
   human handoff request follows (see [Routed human handoffs](#routed-human-handoffs)).
8. **Manager PR frontier** (when `manager.command` is configured; runs in
   `factory manage` after landing). Every open same-repository `agent/<n>` PR
   targeting the configured branch is observed through the schema-1 feedback
   producer; only `owner.relation = factory_issue` (a same-repository closing
   link plus the retained claim) puts it in the frontier, never branch text.
   Initiatives and already-escalated tickets are left alone. Pending CI waits.
   Red CI, unresolved current-head feedback (changes-requested review,
   unresolved non-outdated thread, failed check) and inactivity beyond
   `manager.stale_days` (default 7) escalate the ticket once through the
   ordinary packet, so the manager's `FIX`/`CLOSE`/`HUMAN` decisions apply.
   Late feedback is delivered at most once per `(evidence_id, source_revision)`
   (`feedback-delivered` journal rows); partial or unavailable coverage, unknown
   relevance and the factory's own reviewer are never delivered. `CLOSE` closes
   the PR with the diagnosis; a human's issue stays open with
   `wontfix-proposal`, a child the factory created by `SPLIT` is closed.
   With `manager.review = "all"`, a head that passed the gate and independent
   review is not labelled until the manager returns `APPROVE` for that exact
   head (`manage` row with `head`); a refreshed head needs a fresh decision and
   nothing is re-bound. Decisions are bounded by `manager.rounds` per PR.

## Configuration

`.factory.toml` at the repository root; every key is optional. The template
written by `factory init` documents them all. The ones you will actually set:

The dashboard's **Settings** view (`/#settings`) edits exactly five controls:
`dispatch.max_active` (concurrent tickets), `dispatch.budget_min` (time limit
per ticket, in minutes), `dispatch.max_attempts` (worker and gate attempts),
`dispatch.review_rounds` (reviewer revision rounds), and `manager.model` (the
Factory Manager model). It shows each effective value and its source
(Repository, Host repository override, Host default, or Built-in default), plus
a read-only worker/reviewer/triage summary with command arguments and endpoint
credentials omitted.

Review the explicit before/after summary and choose **Save changes**. The
dashboard writes only changed keys to the local `.factory.toml`, preserving
unrelated settings and comments; changes remain uncommitted (they never commit
or push). If another process changes the configuration first, stale edits are
rejected: reload and review the latest values before saving. Work-limit changes
apply to the next dispatcher invocation; the selected model applies to the next
new Factory Manager request. Running work and in-flight requests keep their
captured configuration unchanged.

Clearing `manager.model` removes the repository override and restores the
existing host value, a legacy `manager.command --model` fallback, or OMP's
default model. Gate and safety policy remain file-managed.

```toml
[repo]
# upstream = "upstream"          # fork workflow: sync upstream main each pass

# cost_pattern = 'Total cost:\s*\$([0-9.]+)'   # $ from the worker log (Claude Code prints this)

[workers]                        # ticket label -> argv; {prompt} file, {cwd} worktree

```

The shared host file is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/factory/config.toml` (default
`~/.config/factory/config.toml`). `[defaults.engine]` belongs to District:
`ref`, `sha`, `previous`, and `installed_at` describe its installed engine
snapshot. Factory leaves this metadata opaque and out of pipeline configuration;
`doctor` accepts it only under `defaults`. Unknown tables and an `engine` table
under a per-repository section still produce host-config warnings.

Labels (`needs-review`, `needs-viability`, `needs-triage`, `needs-info`,
`ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `factory-approved`, `chore`, `initiative`)
and the `agent/<n>` branch scheme are fixed conventions; `factory init` creates
the labels. `needs-review` opts a PR into direction viability and dispatch's review-only intake;
`needs-viability` opts an issue into viability before triage.

Before the manager runs, dispatch discovers open, non-draft PRs labeled
`needs-review` or with a pending review request for the authenticated `gh` account.
Contributor branch names are unrestricted. Intake writes `review-intake` events
with `pr` and `head` to `.factory/events.jsonl`, skipping already-recorded pairs
under the shared PR/issue lock. Dry runs only print eligible revisions. For each
newly admitted revision, the configured `[review]` command receives the diff
between the recorded base and head SHAs. Valid final `VERDICT: APPROVE` or
`VERDICT: REVISE` output publishes an approving or changes-requested GitHub review
through `gh api`, explicitly bound to the recorded head with `commit_id`.
Findings must each cite `path:line`; malformed output or a failed reviewer
publishes nothing. Branch advancement cannot retarget the supplied diff or review.
Prompts exceeding 120 KiB (UTF-8, including the diff) are skipped before reviewer
execution and recorded as `unknown` with reason `prompt_too_large`; intake
continues with the next PR. The recorded revision is not automatically retried.
Dispatch records SHA-specific required-CI readiness for admitted PRs and escalates
exhausted review attempts to a human issue. This lane does not change contributor
branches or merge external PRs.

The dashboard's **Ops → External PR review queue** lists open, non-draft opted-in
PRs, including review-request admissions after GitHub consumes the request.
Each GitHub-linked row shows the repository-local PR number, title, author,
current head SHA, last reviewed SHA and verdict, and required-CI state with its
last observation time. CI evidence comes from dispatch's `review-readiness`
events, not a new CI poll; missing evidence for the current head is unknown.
The six queue states are **pending review**, **changes requested**, **CI pending**,
**CI failed**, **ready**, and **escalated**. An old approval never makes a new head
ready, and readiness is advisory—not permission to merge.
Changes requested, failed CI, escalations, and pending reviews needing human
attention also appear in **Inbox**, with links to GitHub rather than mutation
controls. Viewing or refreshing the queue does not change labels, reviews,
branches, or merge state.

## Operating it

- **Dashboard** (`factory dashboard`): the root opens **Ops**, showing recorded
  pipeline state without requesting an LLM briefing. **Inbox** is an explicit
  destination and opens a full **Understand → Compare → Decide** briefing for
  each case needing human judgment. The question,
  situation, FM recommendation, relevant earlier decisions, uncertainty, options,
  consequences, and next owner stay visible; raw evidence is expandable. **Ops**
  retains the board, telemetry, dispatcher runs, and task drawers.
  **Ask FM** works on a whole task or a specific source/log and returns cited
  answers. The dedicated **Chat** page at `/chat` also answers repository-wide,
  case, and dispatcher-run questions; cited evidence is inspectable and
  conversations persist in that browser. It requires an authenticated `omp`
  installation; `[manager].model` chooses the model (host-wide:
  `[defaults.manager]`). If unset, an existing `manager.command` supplies only
  its `--model` value, otherwise OMP's default model is used. The dashboard never
  executes that command: questions run a bounded, read-only, no-tools OMP process
  against server-collected evidence. Evidence is sent to the selected model
  provider; questions are not posted to GitHub. Errors remain visible and
  retryable, never replaced with canned advice.
  Decisions require rationale and an exact mutation preview; stale or incomplete
  snapshots block execution. Confirmed decisions leave GitHub rationale comments
  and a local `human-decision` audit event with success, partial, or failed outcome.
  Drafts and conversations survive refresh within the same browser session.
  The same navigation row sits below the title/status row on Ops, Inbox, Roadmap,
  Chat, Codebase and Atlas; the two rows stay together while scrolling.
  Its **Theme** picker includes Cyberpunk, GPUFlo, District, Factory, ROCm
  (shared by rocm-cli and rocm-app), Porcelain and Sandstone (light), and Slate
  and Forest (dark). Cyberpunk is the default for installations
  without custom CSS; configured `[dashboard].theme` remains the **Repository**
  default. An explicit choice overrides that CSS and persists in this browser
  for this dashboard origin. Browser storage being unavailable does not prevent
  switching themes for the current page.
- **Spend**: the *Spend* KPI and each ticket's attempts tab total worker+gate
  wall clock from `events.jsonl`, plus dollars when `cost_pattern` matches
  your worker's log.
- **Learning loop**: after a batch of tickets, `factory learn --dry-run`,
  read the proposed lessons, then `factory learn` and commit
  `.factory-lessons.md`. Workers see it on every ticket. The eval signal is the
  dashboard's *first-gate pass* and *bounce rate* KPIs moving after the change;
  edit or delete lessons that don't earn their keep.
- **Audit trail**: `.factory/events.jsonl` retains the ticket outcome events
  (`claimed`, `attempt`, `pr-opened`, `review`, `approved`, `refreshed`,
  `merged`, `escalate`, `upstream-sync`, and `human-decision`) alongside
  versioned `lifecycle` records. See the [event contract](#execution-event-contract)
  below. A ticket's history is local; no GitHub call is needed.
- **Handoff notes**: each worker attempt ends by writing
  `.factory/wt-<n>/.factory/handoff-<n>.md` (what changed, what is unverified,
  what next). The next attempt gets it in its prompt; an escalation quotes it
  in the issue comment.
  Independently accepted handoffs are retained outside the worktree under
  `.factory/results/<ticket>/<accepted-head>/`; see [retention](#accepted-handoff-retention).
- **Logs**: `.factory/logs/<n>-attempt-<k>.log` per worker round;
  `.factory/wt-<n>/.factory/gate-report-<n>.md` per gate;
  `journalctl --user -u factory-<repo>.service` for dispatcher passes.
- **Re-run one ticket by hand**: `factory dispatch --ticket N` (bypasses the
  frontier and its label checks; respects the in-flight lock).
- **Stop everything**: `systemctl --user disable --now factory-<repo>.timer`.
  In-flight tickets finish their current pass; nothing new is claimed.
- **Tear down a ticket**: verify any accepted handoff is retained before manually
  removing `.factory/wt-<n>` with `git worktree remove --force`, deleting `agent/<n>`,
  and re-labelling the issue. Manual removal bypasses the dispatcher's retention guard.

## Accepted handoff retention

Factory retains the full worker handoff at durable, exact-head approval and checks
retention again before merge cleanup. Worker exit zero, gate PASS, a label, or a
valid `REVISE` response cannot establish acceptance. Existing reviewer, configured
manager, CI, human-veto and exact-head merge safeguards are unchanged.

These are **Factory product defaults, per repository**, not host/session retention
settings. There are no configuration overrides in this interface:

| Limit | Default |
|---|---|
| Full handoff content | 90 days from original recorded acceptance |
| Body-free provenance/status receipt | 365 days from that acceptance |
| One artifact | 256 KiB |
| One result bundle, including metadata | 1 MiB |
| Repository result archive, including temporary writes | 256 MiB |

Reads and repeated observations never renew these lifetimes. Expired content is
unavailable immediately to readers; the next non-dry-run dispatcher pass removes
expired payloads, then removes receipts at 365 days. Reads never prune or acquire
writer locks. These limits do not rotate existing journals, logs or transcripts.

Storage is the main checkout's gitignored `.factory/results/<ticket>/<accepted-head>/`,
with a bounded `manifest.json` and, when available, raw `handoff.md`. The manifest
preserves accepted-head provenance, compact acceptance receipts, the first matching
attempt's observed source head (or explicit unknown), source/retained byte counts
and SHA-256 integrity, producer identity, and accepted-contract revision references.
The source head is an observation, not proof of when the handoff was authored.
Refreshing/rebasing does not silently reattribute older bytes to a new head.
A different result never silently replaces an existing record at the same head.

Only the handoff and compact provenance are retained: no transcript, worker log,
prompt, configuration/environment dump, or broad discussion ingestion. Common
credential forms are withheld, not silently redacted; this is not comprehensive
DLP. Explicit incomplete/redacted provenance stays incomplete. Local storage is
not public-safe evidence and does not authorize uploads, new provider disclosure,
or permission changes.

Missing, oversized, withheld, expired, unreadable and integrity-failed sources
remain explicit. Quota or archival failure does not evict unexpired results:
automatic cleanup leaves the affected worktree intact and reports the reason.
Post-merge cleanup is not automatically retried: resolve the reported retention
condition before manual cleanup rather than deleting the sole surviving copy.
A recorded missing-source result can permit cleanup because there is no handoff
content to lose. This protects against worktree cleanup, not runner loss or deletion
of the main checkout; it is not a backup service.

Use the `kind:"result"` evidence read below for a known ticket/head, even when the
ticket is outside current GitHub case-list coverage. Briefings include the newest
retained historical result without displacing earlier human constraints.
Retention and historical acceptance are evidence, never permission to resume or
rewrite scope. The worker prompt built by `factory dispatch` is the one
revision-aware execution consumer: when a ticket has a prior retained result, its
prompt gets a bounded `## Resume context` section reporting the prior accepted
head/result and whether the admitted scope (this ticket's plan-bound baseline)
is `unchanged`, `changed`, or `unavailable` since that result, using only the
local plan-bound journal and the retained result -- never a worker log, prompt,
or transcript. This is descriptive only: it never rewrites the pinned scope or
the ticket, and a changed or unavailable comparison never silently authorizes
continued execution.

## Execution event contract

`.factory/events.jsonl` is the single append-only journal for legacy ticket
outcomes and authoritative execution evidence. An execution is one entered
scope, not a ticket's entire history. A dispatcher pass, an independent triage
run with no tickets, every worker attempt, and each later PR revisit have their
own identities. Parent/child scopes may overlap; never collapse them into the
newest ticket event.

### Version 1 lifecycle rows

Every `event: "lifecycle"` row includes all these keys. `null` means not
applicable or not known; it is not a fabricated ticket, run, round, or result.

| Key | JSON type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `event` | string | Always `"lifecycle"`. |
| `schema_version` | integer | `1`; unversioned ticket events are not lifecycle version 1. |
| `event_id` | string (UUID) | Stable identity of this transition. Ordinary events use UUIDv4; reconciled interruption exits use a deterministic UUIDv5 per execution. |
| `sequence` | integer, ≥1 | Starts at 1, increases strictly within `execution_id`, allocated under the journal lock. |
| `execution_id` | string (UUID) | One stage invocation; never reused for a retry or revisit. |
| `parent_execution_id` | string (UUID) or null | Immediately enclosing execution, including across instrumented subprocess launches; null for an independent root. |
| `root_execution_id` | string (UUID) | Root execution of this causal tree; an independent execution names itself. |
| `dispatcher_run_id` | string (UUID) or null | Shared by a real dispatcher pass and its descendants. An independently invoked triage or gate has null, not an invented dispatcher run. |
| `ticket` | integer or null | Associated issue number; dispatcher, scheduling, and no-ticket triage scopes need no issue. |
| `attempt` | integer or null | Existing worker-attempt numbering, inherited by its gate. Review-bounce attempts retain the existing `max_attempts + bounce` numbering. |
| `review_round` | integer or null | Initial review is 1; revision worker/gate/review scopes use `bounce + 1`. Initial worker/gate scopes and unrelated activity have null. |
| `stage` | string | Actual entered scope, listed below; not inferred from labels or artifact times. |
| `kind` | string | `"enter"`, `"exit"`, or an evidence event listed below. |
| `at` | string | UTC source timestamp, ISO 8601 with microseconds and `Z`. A reconciled exit uses the time of observation, not an estimated crash time. |
| `outcome` | string or null | Terminal classification on `exit`; null on other kinds. |
| `reason` | string or null | Supported terminal reason or diagnostic text, not a closed enumeration; null when no reason is known. |
| `process` | object or null | Owner identity sampled on entry: `pid` (integer), `boot_id` (string or null), `start_ticks` (integer or null), `pid_namespace` (string or null), `uid` (integer or null), `state` (Linux process-state string or null), `ppid` (integer or null). Factory emits an object; the reader also accepts null as unavailable authority. This cached identity is not a live heartbeat. |
| `locks` | array of objects | Recorded exclusion evidence, possibly empty. Each object has `path` (absolute-path string), `device` (integer or null), and `inode` (integer or null). Null identity fields mean unavailable evidence. |

IDs and sequence numbers survive repeated reads. Sort a single execution by
`sequence`, use parent/root/run IDs for causality, and deduplicate by `event_id`.
Neither wall-clock timestamps nor physical append order establish a causal total
order across independent executions. A scope has one `enter` and at most one
terminal `exit`; an abrupt death can leave the exit absent until observation
has enough evidence to reconcile it. Extra keys and evidence kinds may be
added; consumers should ignore those they do not understand. Unsupported schema
versions are not interpreted as version 1 by the existing observer.

| Stage | Boundary |
|---|---|
| `dispatcher` | One real dispatcher pass, including passes with no ticket. Completion means the pass ended, not that any ticket merged. |
| `scheduling` | Frontier/capacity evaluation and scheduling; separate from ticket execution and merge eligibility. |
| `landing` | The existing nonblocking merge-lock request and, when acquired, upstream sync/merge pass through actual unlock. |
| `ticket` | A ticket admission/invocation, including nonblocking lock request and admission re-read. Admission refusal is not worker time. Later PR passes have separate `merge-eligibility` executions. |
| `triage`, `triage-ticket` | Whole triage invocation and each actual ticket decision. Standalone triage retains its own root identity and null dispatcher association. |
| `worker` | One worker subprocess attempt. |
| `gate`, `gate-check` | An invoked gate and each actually executed check. Skipped checks and a disabled leak scan do not enter a check scope. |
| `review` | One reviewer invocation, attributed to its review round. |
| `merge-eligibility` | Assessment/refresh of one candidate in this dispatcher pass; not a merge. |
| `merge` | Actual PR merge or upstream integration (which may contain a gate child). Only a successful PR merge or upstream push records `merged`. Approval alone does not. |
| `resource-observation`, `scheduling-observation` | Change-only local evidence records, not pipeline invocations. They have stable observation-scope execution/root IDs, no `enter`/`exit`, and null parent/dispatcher/ticket/attempt/round fields; execution occupancy excludes them. |

Evidence kinds retain the common keys above and add these kind-specific keys:

| Kind | Additional keys |
|---|---|
| `handoff` | `handoff_id`: UUID string, persisted before launching a child. |
| `child_start` | `child_process`: process identity object; `handoff_id`: UUID string or null. |
| `child_exit` | `child_process`: the recorded child identity object. |
| `lock_acquired`, `lock_released` | `lock`: path string; `locks` reflects the updated recorded set. |
| `check` | `check`: string check name. |
| `timeout` | `command`: array of argument strings; `timeout_seconds`: integer. |
| `result` | Depending on the mechanism: `returncode` (integer), `command` (argument-string array or string), `timed_out` (boolean), `timeout_seconds` (integer), `check` (string), `passed` (boolean), `verdict` (`"APPROVE"` or `"REVISE"`), and/or `parsed` (boolean). These keys are present only when that evidence was obtained. |
| Ordinary `exit` with unreaped children | `evidence`: object containing `children` (process identity/state objects as below). Default `completed` becomes `unknown`; a supported exception classification is retained. |
| Reconciled `exit` | `reconciled`: true; `observer_process`: process identity object; `evidence`: the observation object described below. |

### Outcomes and uncertainty

| `outcome` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `completed` | The entered operation returned normally; not a claim that a ticket or PR is complete. |
| `product_feedback` | Configured checks found failing code, a parsed successful reviewer requested `REVISE`, or triage requested information/human attention/proposed wontfix. |
| `project_escalation` | The existing project escalation path ran; not a broken runtime mechanism. |
| `approved`, `merged`, `refreshed` | The corresponding operation succeeded; these are distinct outcomes. |
| `not_admitted`, `not_eligible` | Admission re-read refused the ticket, or merge prerequisites did not allow merging. No skipped downstream scope is invented. |
| `mechanism_failure` | Evidence that the configured mechanism could not run, such as a missing/permission-denied executable or unavailable triage endpoint. |
| `unknown` | The cause is unsupported or uncertain, including unexplained worker/reviewer nonzero exits, unparsed verdicts, command/API errors, and timeouts. A timeout alone is not proof of runtime failure. |
| `interrupted` | A previously unterminated execution was reconciled using authoritative liveness and lock evidence. |

Reasons include `configured_check_failed`, `conflict_markers`,
`leak_scan_matches`, `APPROVE`/`REVISE`, `check_timeout`,
`triage_endpoint_unavailable`, `no_tickets`, `state_changed`, `ci_pending`,
and `no_passing_ci`; exceptions may instead provide diagnostic text. Reasons
are evidence, not a replacement for `outcome`. Existing gate exit codes,
review retry behavior, claim locks, concurrency limits, and merge prerequisites
are unchanged.

### Observation, interrupted writes, and CLI semantics

The existing dashboard snapshot (`factory dashboard --json` or
`/api/snapshot`) includes an additive top-level `executions` array. It retains
every observed execution, including concurrent stages, no-ticket runs, and local
evidence when GitHub collection fails. Each entry contains
`execution_id`, `parent_execution_id`, `root_execution_id`,
`dispatcher_run_id`, `ticket`, `attempt`, `review_round`, and `stage` with the
types above, plus:

- `state`: `"active"`, `"completed"`, `"failed"`, `"interrupted"`, or `"unknown"`.
  Only `mechanism_failure` maps to `failed`; product feedback/escalation and
  other known ordinary outcomes map to `completed`.
- `entered_at`: source `enter` timestamp; `ended_at`: source/observed exit
  timestamp or null. An exit with unknown outcome has an `ended_at` but is
  not active.
- `outcome` and `reason`: terminal values or null while unterminated.
- `events`: source lifecycle rows in sequence order.
- `evidence`: normally null on ordinary terminal exits, or the partial
  `children` object above when the scope exited before reaping its children.
  An unterminated/reconciled observation instead has an object with
  `process` (`"alive"`, `"dead"`, `"unknown"`), `children` (objects with
  `process` identity and the same `state` values), `locks` (recorded lock
  objects plus `state`: `"held"`, `"free"`, or `"unknown"`), `descendants`
  (process identities), `scan_complete` (boolean: process-scan readability),
  `descendant_absence_proven` (boolean: authoritative absence of surviving
  descendants), and `pending_handoffs` (UUID-string array).
- `wait`: the current known wait object plus source `event_id` and `at`, or null. It is distinct from
  execution liveness: a live waiting process can have `state: "active"` without
  doing check/worker work. Unknown/dead/terminal executions do not retain a
  current wait; their source wait rows remain historical evidence.

Observation uses Linux `/proc`, boot identity, PID namespace, process start
ticks, recorded children/causal descendant context, and existing lock inodes.
A reused PID or an old artifact cannot prove activity. A positively identified
live owner or descendant is active, even if its parent ended. On the same boot,
a held lock alone prevents declaring interruption but does not identify an
active stage.
Inaccessible/incomplete process evidence, a missing/replaced lock inode, or an
unresolved launch-registration gap yields unknown when no live process can be
proven. For an execution that previously launched a process tree (including
through nested scopes), a same-boot scan cannot rule out a reparented orphan
that removed its lifecycle environment. It therefore remains unknown after
the last recorded/tagged survivor disappears; absence from the scan is not
proof that the entire tree ended. A still-live registered or tagged child
remains active. An abruptly killed scope that never launched descendants can
be reconciled when its recorded process is known dead, no pending handoff
remains, and its recorded locks are free. Interruption requires authoritative
evidence that every possible descendant ended, not merely that none was found.
A known boot-ID change proves the previous execution and its descendants ended,
even with a pending handoff or a lock held by a current-boot process. A same-boot
PID-namespace mismatch remains unknown. `scan_complete` alone never proves
descendant absence; this conservative limitation also applies to open ancestor
scopes of a launched tree.
Observation does not change scheduling or lock ownership.

The first conclusive observation appends one stable interruption exit under the
journal lock. Repeated observations reuse that record and its actual observation
time; they do not manufacture another transition. Thus dashboard observation can
write reconciliation evidence locally, but does not mutate GitHub. The existing
15-second HTTP snapshot cache remains; `?fresh=1` requests a fresh observation.
No separate lifecycle CLI or additional network probe is introduced.

The existing ticket `phase` is null unless there is one unambiguous active,
non-waiting leaf among its unresolved executions. Active wrappers do not hide their child
stage; an unknown child or simultaneous independent stages prevents selecting
one. When present, `phase` keeps `at` (source entry timestamp), `artifact`
(legacy field name, now the authoritative stage string), and `attempt`
(integer or null), and adds `execution_id` (UUID string). Logs/reports remain
available as evidence, never as stage truth. A ticket lock still drives the
existing in-flight/admission count, not proof of a particular executing phase.

All Factory producers serialize complete UTF-8 JSON lines under a shared file `flock`,
flush and fsync before returning, and allocate execution ordering under that
same lock. Readers accept only newline-terminated JSON objects and skip malformed
JSON, non-object rows, and unterminated tails. On the next append an unterminated
tail is invalidated with a NUL byte and newline before the new record; even a
syntactically complete but uncommitted tail is never promoted into activity.
Old unversioned rows retain their existing event names and fields without
retrofitted IDs, stages, or liveness. New legacy ticket events emitted within
an execution also carry `execution_id` (UUID string) and `dispatcher_run_id`
(UUID string or null) as causal references; they are still not lifecycle rows.
Dashboard spend counts only legacy `attempt` rows;
`learn` excludes lifecycle rows from finished-ticket selection and evidence;
`stats` still uses GitHub issue/PR comments, so lifecycle exits do not double
attempt, review, or outcome counts. `dispatch --dry-run` and
`triage --dry-run`/`--replay` record no lifecycle activity.
Dispatcher dry-run does not create claim/merge lock files or fetch remote refs.
With an upstream configured, it reports that a real pass would fetch and
evaluate upstream rather than claiming a fresh behind/ahead count.

### F02 waits and evidenced resource ownership

F02 adds evidence to the version 1 lifecycle journal, not a second telemetry
stream, controller, resource broker, or lock. All rows retain the identities,
sequence, source timestamps, and interruption rules above. The bounded F03
runtime CLI below reads these same producer records without persisting observations.

Known waits use `kind: "wait"` with a `wait` object:

| Key | Type and meaning |
|---|---|
| `reason` | Nonempty string for a known reason; absent knowledge is represented by no current wait, never guessed from elapsed duration. |
| `mode` | `"blocking"` (an actual acquisition can block), `"retry_next_pass"` (this pass skips), `"admission"` (capacity decision), or `"eligibility"` (observed merge prerequisite). |
| `resource` | Resource descriptor below, or null for non-resource waits. |
| `details` | Object containing only decision evidence available at that point. |

`wait_end` ends a blocking wait when acquisition succeeds; a request itself is
not acquisition. A terminal scope ends its current wait without claiming the
underlying prerequisite became satisfied. Nonblocking skips, capacity decisions,
and merge eligibility remain historical decision facts after their scope exits,
not indefinitely active stages.

| Reason | Existing observation point / details |
|---|---|
| `capacity_reached` | Admission count reached `max_active`; `active` and `max_active` integers. Demand does not prove dispatcher liveness. |
| `ticket_lock_contended` | Ticket preflight found the lock held or its nonblocking acquisition lost the race; retry next pass. |
| `merge_lock_contended` | Nonblocking landing lock miss; skip this pass, retry next pass, never convert to a blocking wait. |
| `exclusive_resource` | Gate observed its exclusive lock held before the unchanged blocking acquisition. |
| `ci_pending` | Existing `pr_checks` result contained pending checks; `pr` integer. No extra CI query or polling loop. |
| `no_passing_ci` | Existing result had no passing check; `pr` integer. The cause is unknown, not an inferred CI outage. |
| `scheduled_next_pass` | Local timer explicitly active, service explicitly idle, and a future `next_at` timestamp reported by the existing systemctl seam. |

Review revision, escalation, eligibility, execution-stage occupancy, and waits
are separate facts. None of these reasons, a held resource, or elapsed time
alone creates a machinery incident. Gate outcomes and CI/human-veto prerequisites
are unchanged.

Resource events distinguish `resource_requested`, enriched `lock_acquired`, and
enriched `lock_released`. Each includes a `resource` descriptor. Only an actual
successful flock acquisition supplies confirmed holder evidence. Acquired and
released rows share an `acquisition_id`, so delayed evidence for an older holder
cannot clear a newer acquisition. Inherited F01 `locks` support liveness only:
children and dispatcher parents do not thereby become resource owners.

The gate subprocess acquires its exclusive lock once, immediately before the
first non-skipped exclusive check, and retains it through all remaining checks.
Ticket locks span the pipeline; the landing lock spans upstream sync and merge.
There are no new exclusion locks, changes to acquisition order, retry policy,
capacity accounting, check execution, or scheduling.


Resource descriptors and observations have this serialized contract:

| Descriptor key | Type and supported scope |
|---|---|
| `id` | Opaque UUID string, stable for the canonical lock pathname and supported scope; not a ticket number or dependency name. |
| `scope` | `"repository"` for ticket/merge exclusion, or `"host"` for the configured exclusive gate lock. |
| `host_id` | Opaque host identity string derived from machine identity; without machine identity, limited to the current boot. If neither authority exists, a process-local opaque fallback prevents cross-host grouping and observations remain unknown. |
| `repository` | Canonical journal-directory string for repository scope; null for host scope. Different repository journals do not imply shared ticket/merge exclusion. |
| `lock` | F01-style `path`, `device`, `inode` evidence for the canonical pathname. Missing inode/device is unknown authority. |

Host-scoped IDs permit grouping only observations of the same configured lock
on the same supported host identity. Different lock paths are not the same
GPU or dependency merely because their check names match. Canonical symlink
paths coincide; hard-link aliases and independently configured paths are not
automatically unified. Identity names a lock pathname, not every past inode
unlinked from it. A replaced inode cannot confirm an old acquisition. A single
repository's observation does not prove every factory is affected; no journal
from another repository is read to guess its holder.

All three resource operation kinds add `blocking` (boolean: acquisition mode)
and `acquisition_id` (UUID string for acquired/matched released; null on
requested or an unmatched release, which cannot clear a holder).
The F01 `lock` path remains on acquired/released rows. The common execution,
root, parent, dispatcher, ticket, attempt, review-round, and process fields
identify the actual requester/holder; request identity is never substituted for
holder identity. `wait_end.wait_event_id` names the ended wait's event UUID.

| Resource observation key | Type and meaning |
|---|---|
| `resource` | Descriptor above. |
| `state`, `ownership` | Independent string enums described above. `none` is supported only by observed free state. |
| `owner` | Null or object with all common execution identity fields, recorded `process`, `acquisition_id`, and source `acquired_at` timestamp. |
| `requests` | Array of currently live, unterminated requesters not yet acquired/released: common execution identity fields, `process`, source `event_id`, `requested_at`, and `blocking`. A pending request is not ownership. |
| `evidence` | Object: `lock_state` (`held`/`free`/`unknown`), `attribution` (`proc_locks`/`unavailable`), `holder_pids` (integer array or null). Kernel PIDs alone are not confirmed execution identity. |
| `event_id`, `at` | Stable identity and source time of the last distinct local resource observation. |
| `observed_at` | UTC time of this local evidence collection, distinct from transition time. |

Changes are persisted as `kind: "resource_observation"` in the same lifecycle
journal, carrying `resource`, `state`, `ownership`, `owner`, `requests`, and
`evidence`. Observer rows have `reconciled: true` and the observer's `process`.
Acquisition/release history remains separate from current attribution.

`dispatcher.schedule` contains `wait` (the wait object above or null),
`timer_active` and `service_active` (boolean or null), `event_id`, `at`, and
`observed_at` with the same transition-versus-collection distinction.
Change-only `kind: "scheduling_observation"` rows carry `wait`, `timer_active`,
and `service_active`; scheduled wait details include `next_at` (UTC timestamp).

The full dashboard JSON adds `resources`. Each resource observation separates
`state` (`held`, `free`, `unknown`) from `ownership` (`confirmed`, `unknown`,
`none`). A held lock is not proof of ownership. Confirmation requires both a
live recorded process identity and matching kernel lock attribution; missing
authority, external processes, old F01-only lock rows, and attribution gaps
remain unknown. A dead recorded execution is never retained as a confirmed
current holder, even if its old lock remains held.

Resource observation timestamps describe when evidence was collected. A
reconciled ownership change or free observation does not invent the exact time
an unobserved process died or released its lock. Repeated unchanged observations
reuse transition identity/time rather than producing repeated release/wait events.

`dispatcher.timer.active` and `dispatcher.service_active` now accept null when
local authority is unavailable. False means explicitly inactive/failed, not a
missing command, inaccessible service manager, or absent output. The additive
`dispatcher.schedule` records timer/service evidence and a known scheduled wait
only when confirmed; otherwise its `wait` is null. Timer interval configuration
and an empty frontier do not establish next-pass intention or deliberate pause.
Dashboard status/configuration display unknown and suppress unsupported
countdowns. Schedule observations never create a dispatcher-run identity.

Because the journal may contain a torn row, a tolerant local ticket query is:

```sh
python - <<'PY'
import json
from pathlib import Path
from factory.lifecycle import read_events
for row in read_events(Path(".factory/events.jsonl")):
    if row.get("ticket") == 42:
        print(json.dumps(row))
PY
```

## Source-versioned PR feedback (schema 1)

The full `factory dashboard --json` / `/api/snapshot` observation exposes
`tickets[].pr.feedback`. The existing Review drawer, Inbox raw evidence, and
`factory.briefing.sources_for` consume this same object. Non-PR tickets have no
fabricated feedback. `--runtime-json` does not invoke this collector
and retains its network-free contract.

`factory.feedback.collect(read, *, repository, pr, issue=None, events=(),
provenance_complete=True, producer_revision=None, observed_at=None,
collect_details=True)` is the shared producer. `read` is the existing dashboard
GitHub transport, accepting `endpoint` for fixed REST GETs or `query`/`variables`
for GraphQL reads, plus a remaining `timeout`. Source exceptions become sanitized
coverage/errors without discarding independently observed facts. There is no
feedback cache, event append, model invocation, delivery, dispatch, readiness, or
approval decision. The full dashboard's pre-existing lifecycle reconciliation
remains unchanged.

Detail reads are limited to open pull requests, so closed history never
multiplies provider calls per refresh. `collect_details=False` reads nothing: the
schema-1 envelope still carries the caller's independently known repository/PR
identities and state, `head_sha` stays null, every source is `unavailable` with
the `not_collected` reason/error code, and ownership stays `unverified`. Review,
Inbox and briefing report that intentional noncollection explicitly; it is not an
empty, resolved, or unsupported observation, and it is distinct from an older
engine that has no `feedback` key at all.

The required envelope is `schema_version`, `producer`, `observed_at`,
`observation_id`, `repository`, `pr`, `owner`, `coverage`, `items`, and `errors`.
Native repository/PR IDs are retained alongside host/slug, PR number/URL/head,
state and nullable draft. Ownership needs an actual same-repository closing-issue
link plus retained Factory claim provenance; branch text and shared credentials
do not establish it. Relations are `factory_issue`, `unverified`, `ambiguous`,
or `none`. A missing key or unsupported schema is unknown, not an empty success.

Items retain native source IDs/links, source revision/update time, review/thread/
check-run IDs, nullable run attempt, source versus observed head, disposition,
author, body/truncation, location and provider name/title. Kinds are `review`,
`review_comment`, `check_run`, `commit_status`, and `factory_review`; all can
coexist. Review state, thread resolved/outdated state, and check status/conclusion
remain independent. Missing source SHA is never filled with the current head.
Relevance is `current_head`, `historical`, or `unknown`; outdated threads cannot
become current through SHA equality. Provider User attribution remains unknown
because shared credentials may belong to Factory. A Factory review requires a
valid recorded review execution result, successful parse/exit and matching target
SHA; ordinary discussion or `VERDICT` prose is legacy context, not that evidence.
Unavailable provider fields remain explicit nulls (including check-run update
time or run attempt when the API does not supply them).

Fixed bounds in `factory/feedback.py`: `ITEM_LIMIT=100` per reviews, threads/
comments and checks/statuses; `PAGE_LIMIT=2`; `BODY_LIMIT=20000` UTF-8 bytes per
body; `ERROR_LIMIT=32`; `DETAIL_TIMEOUT=30` seconds, with initial/final head reads.
Reviews and review threads are read as bounded GraphQL connections carrying native
IDs, links, the reviewed commit and the provider's own `updatedAt` (an edited review
revises it; a submission time would not). Both use up to two pages; the combined
checks source reserves one page for native check runs and one for commit statuses. Nested thread comment
overflow is explicit rather than an unbounded fan-out. Provenance reuses the
existing safe, bounded 2 MB committed-event tail reader. Every source (`pr`,
`reviews`, `threads`, `checks`) reports `status` (`complete`, `partial`,
`unavailable`), nullable `observed_at`/`reason`, and `truncated`. A cap, malformed
response, missing SHA, failed read, or head race never establishes disappearance
or resolution. A failed final read exposes an unknown head; raced reads retain
facts and both observed heads while making relevance unknown. Truncated text
without a reliable provider update signal explicitly lacks byte-exact change
detection beyond the retained body.

Canonical JSON is UTF-8, sorted keys, compact separators and explicit nulls.
Identity strings are stripped/NFC-normalized; host/slug and SHA hex are lowercase.
Evidence IDs namespace provider, host, repository ID, PR ID, kind and source ID.
`source_revision` is `sha256:` over exactly `kind`, `source_id`, `review_id`,
`thread_id`, `check_run_id`, `run_attempt`, `source_head_sha`, `source_updated_at`,
`author`, `body`, `truncated`, `location`, `disposition`, `summary`.
`observation_id` hashes repository/PR native IDs, final observed head, sorted
`(evidence_id, source_revision)` pairs, and coverage status/truncated/reason.
Collection timestamps, URLs, relevance and presentation order are excluded.
Unchanged polls keep identity; edits/resolution/dismissal/outcome changes revise
the same source. The producer revision is a clean source-checkout Git revision,
otherwise null, never a CLI version.

Briefing appends feedback behind existing evidence and human constraints and
reports omissions in its reserved coverage citation. Source text is quoted
untrusted evidence, rendered through safe text helpers. No consumer may infer
delivery, fixed status, merge approval or readiness from this read-only schema.
B2 (#79) does not authorize #15 delivery or change its held status; acceptance
requires the actual merged producer revision and a separately authorized handoff.

## Bounded runtime JSON (schema 1)

`factory dashboard --runtime-json` prints one JSON object and exits. It is a
separate local read path, **not** a filtered full snapshot. `--json`, HTTP
`/api/snapshot`, and the normal dashboard retain their existing slower GitHub,
triage-probe, and writable reconciliation behavior described above.

The runtime command accepts no server options (`--host`, `--port`, `--no-open`)
and cannot be combined with `--json`. Argument errors exit 2. Fatal repository
discovery/configuration errors exit nonzero with a sanitized diagnostic on stderr
and no runtime JSON. A usable projection, including partial or wholly unavailable
runtime sources, exits 0: inspect `errors` and observation quality, not just exit
status. Missing GitHub credentials are irrelevant; this command never invokes
`gh`, remote Git operations, model probes, or network APIs.

### Consumer contract

All listed keys are required unless explicitly described as kind-specific.
Nullable values mean unknown/not applicable, never zero, stopped, or a newly
observed transition. Times are UTC ISO 8601 strings. Source times remain unchanged
on repeated reads; `generated_at` and `observed_at` are collection times, not
event freshness. Consumers must ignore additive keys and reject unsupported
schema versions rather than interpreting them as version 1.

| Top-level key | Type / meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema_version` | Integer, exactly `1`; implemented runtime contract, independent of package version. |
| `generated_at` | UTC string, generation time of this projection. |
| `repo` | Configured `owner/repository` string from the main checkout. |
| `dispatcher` | Local service/timer/admission evidence object below. |
| `executions` | Independent execution objects below; overlapping stages are retained. |
| `resources` | Current resource evidence objects below. |
| `events` | Bounded deduplicated supported lifecycle records; never synthetic poll events. |
| `history` | Explicit retained-window coverage object below. |
| `errors` | At most 32 structured partial-error objects, `{source, scope, code}` strings. No exception text, credentials, configuration dumps, or log excerpts. |

`dispatcher` has nullable booleans `service_active`, `timer_active`, and `paused`;
nullable UTC `next_at`; UTC `observed_at`; string `observation`; `capacity`;
`run_ids` (sorted dispatcher-run identity strings); and `latest_transition`
(null or `{event_id, at, execution_id, kind}` from a returned `enter`/`exit`).
Latest means the last retained observed transition in journal order, not an
artifact modification. `capacity` has `configured` (integer), `active` (integer
or null, actual held ticket admission locks), and `complete` (boolean).
Stage count is not admission count. An unavailable service query is null,
not false; inactive service evidence alone does not establish unexpected stop.
`paused` is null because the current producer has no recorded pause intention.
No scheduled intention is inferred from a configured interval.

Each execution has the eight common F01 identity fields (`dispatcher_run_id`,
`root_execution_id`, `execution_id`, `parent_execution_id`, `ticket`, `attempt`,
`review_round`, `stage`) with their types above, plus `state` (`active`,
`completed`, `failed`, `interrupted`, `unknown`), nullable `entered_at`,
`ended_at`, `outcome`, `reason`, and `wait`; `latest_event_id`, `latest_at`;
`observation` and `observed_at`. `wait` uses the F02 object plus source `event_id`
and `at`. The events live only in the top-level array, not duplicated per scope.
An entry outside the bounded window has null `entered_at` and explicit partial
coverage. A missing stage is never reconstructed from logs or artifacts.
Resource/scheduling observation scopes do not become executions.

Recorded exits retain their actual source times and ordinary outcome semantics.
A locally proven interruption without a stored exit changes only the current
execution state: no event is appended, no completion UUID is manufactured, and
`ended_at` stays null. Direct process identity and registered children can prove
liveness. The runtime path does not scan every process environment; missing
descendant evidence remains partial/unknown, not a fabricated completion.
A known boot change can still prove interruption. Unsupported older records
never establish current execution activity.

Resources retain the F02 descriptor, `state`, `ownership`, `owner`, `requests`,
and kernel `evidence` types documented above, plus `observation` and UTC
`observed_at`. `event_id` and `at` are nullable: they identify a retained,
matching persisted observation, not the latest request or this poll. A current
kernel observation without such a record has no invented transition identity
or onset. Confirmation requires matching acquisition identity, inode, kernel
holder PID, and live process identity. A request, inherited lock, replaced inode,
or external holder never becomes a confirmed owner. Released/terminal holders
are removed; source request/acquisition/release events remain in `events`.

### Bounds and partial sources

Repository discovery runs local `git --no-optional-locks rev-parse`; only when a
slug is absent does it run local `git remote get-url origin`. These do not fetch
or contact remotes. The normal main-checkout lookup and host/repository
`merge`/`host_filter` precedence are retained. Only runtime configuration fields
are interpreted: slug, nonnegative integer `dispatch.max_active`, and gate lock.
Each repository/host TOML read is capped at 256 KiB. Invalid runtime configuration
produces `factory: runtime configuration unavailable or invalid`, without echoing
the input. Unrelated worker/model/check settings are not evaluated.

Three allowlisted `systemctl --user` queries read service state, timer state,
and JSON timers. Each local command has a 0.5-second deadline, stdout strictly
below 64 KiB, discarded stderr, and at most another 0.5 seconds for reap after
kill. At most five commands run (four with an explicit slug). The D-Bus address
is forced to a local Unix socket, never an inherited TCP address. Missing tools,
unavailable units, invalid output, overflow and timeouts yield partial errors.
Only explicit `ActiveState=active` is true; transitional states remain unknown.
`next_at` requires an active timer and an explicitly returned future timestamp.
Admission scans at most 1024 directory entries and a 256 KiB kernel lock window;
unreadable/incomplete evidence returns null capacity, not a false zero.

System query errors use source `systemctl`, scope `service`, `timer`, or
`schedule`, and codes `invalid_unit`, `timeout`, `output_limit`, `command_failed`,
`command_unavailable`, `unit_unavailable`, `transitioning`, `unit_failed`,
`invalid_state`, or `invalid_schedule`. Admission errors use source `admission`,
scope `repository`, with `missing`, `unreadable`, `unsupported_file`, `byte_limit`,
`entry_limit`, `changed`, or `invalid_kernel_locks`. Errors contain fixed codes
only; raw stderr and arbitrary stored diagnostic text are never returned.

The journal reader performs one `pread` of at most **1,048,576 bytes** at the
end of the regular file, with no journal lock. It drops the first clipped line,
accepts only newline-terminated UTF-8 JSON objects of at most **16,384 bytes**
(including newline), rejects nonfinite numbers/depth over 32, and returns at most
**512 newest supported unique event identities**. Both bounds clip the beginning,
never promote an uncommitted last line. No logs or full lifetime journal scan.
Concurrent size/mtime changes mark the read partial; it is not an atomic snapshot
across files, processes, or service queries. Ordinary local filesystem reads are
assumed responsive; byte limits do not promise recovery from a kernel-stalled
filesystem.

`history` has these required fields:

| Key | Type / semantics |
|---|---|
| `source` | String, `events.jsonl`. |
| `status` | `empty` for an existing zero-byte journal; `available` for a readable nonempty journal (even with no usable records); `missing`; or `unreadable`. |
| `start_at`, `end_at` | Nullable UTC strings: minimum/maximum **returned supported** source timestamps, not file age or an inferred lifetime interval. Both null when none survive. |
| `complete` | Boolean: the present file was fully covered without detected gaps; never a promise of exhaustive lifetime history or producer instrumentation. An empty existing file is complete with a null interval. Missing/unreadable storage is incomplete. |
| `truncated` | Boolean: a byte/event bound clipped the beginning. Corruption is a gap, not necessarily truncation. |
| `gaps` | Deduplicated fixed code strings in deterministic discovery order. |
| `bytes_read`, `byte_limit`, `event_limit`, `retained_events` | Nonnegative integers; actual journal bytes read, 1048576, 512, and returned unique event count. |

Truncation makes the execution census partial: entire still-open scopes can be
outside this window. Do not interpret an empty returned execution array as proof
of no work when history is partial. Retained mid-execution scopes have unknown
state and null entry time unless the entry is actually retained. A corrupt or
unsupported suffix may hide an exit: affected open executions become unknown,
while unaffected recorded terminal facts survive. No intermediate transition,
entry time, completion, or lifetime interval is inferred.

Events are returned in retained physical journal order. Within an execution,
reduce by `sequence`; wall clocks and append order do not impose causality across
independent scopes. Exact duplicate identities are returned once, using the first
copy in the selected window. Conflicting copies of an identity, or different
identities reusing one execution sequence, keep the first copy and mark
`duplicate_conflict`; consumers must not replay the conflicting copy. Execution
identity inconsistencies and missing sequences are gaps. Executions/resources
use first-retained-appearance order (configured resource descriptors are appended
when absent); requests use execution reduction order. All are deterministic for
unchanged storage/evidence. `latest_event_id`/`latest_at` use the greatest retained
execution sequence; `dispatcher.latest_transition` uses physical order.

Event common keys/types are F01 above. Supported kinds are `enter`, `exit`,
`handoff`, `child_start`, `child_exit`, `check`, `result`, `timeout`,
`lock_acquired`, `lock_released`, `resource_requested`, `wait`, `wait_end`,
`resource_observation`, and `scheduling_observation`. Kind-specific optional
fields are `handoff_id`, `wait_event_id`, `acquisition_id` (identity strings,
nullable where F01/F02 permits); `blocking`, `parsed`, `timed_out`, `reconciled`,
`passed` (booleans); `returncode`, `timeout_seconds` (integers); `check` (bounded
string); `verdict` (`APPROVE`/`REVISE`); and the documented `child_process`,
`resource`, `lock`, and `wait`. Resource observations retain their sanitized F02
state/owner/request/evidence fields. Scheduling observations retain nullable
`timer_active`, `service_active`, and `wait`.

Supported outcomes are `completed`, `mechanism_failure`, `interrupted`,
`unknown`, `product_feedback`, `project_escalation`, `approved`, `merged`,
`refreshed`, `not_admitted`, and `not_eligible`; unknown outcome strings become
null. Only known producer reason codes (including numeric worker/review/merge/push
exit reasons) survive. Arbitrary diagnostic reasons become null, including
`wait.reason` when unsupported. Wait details retain only nonnegative integer
`active`, `max_active`, `pr`, and valid UTC `next_at` when present. Raw commands,
exception messages, arbitrary details, and unknown extra fields are omitted.
Identity/stage strings are at most 256 characters; paths at most 4096; each event
has at most 64 recorded locks. Invalid authority is a gap, not confirmed activity.

Execution `evidence` is required and nullable. When present it has `process`
(`alive`/`dead`/`unknown`), `children` (process/state objects), `locks` (F01
descriptors plus held/free/unknown state), `descendants` (empty array: no whole
process scan), `scan_complete` and `descendant_absence_proven` (booleans), and
`pending_handoffs` (identity-string array). These flags do not prove absent
descendants across missing history. Observation quality is `fresh`, `partial`,
or `unavailable`; fresh describes current evidence collection, not a recent
source event. No age-based stale threshold is invented by Factory.
History-window completeness and current observation quality are independent:
older byte/event truncation does not degrade a fully retained later execution,
current dispatcher probes or confirmed lock ownership. A clipped execution's
missing entry, conflicting identity/sequence, ambiguous suffix or unavailable
live evidence still makes that record partial/unknown; history gaps remain
reported even when independent current observations are fresh.

Direct identity checks are cached for at most 128 PIDs, with 4096-byte `/proc`
stat reads, a 64 KiB mounts read, 128-byte boot/machine identity reads, and at
most 512 cached lock stats. Resource attribution reads `/proc/locks` once, under
1 MiB; at most 128 current holder PIDs are returned per resource. Hitting these
bounds yields unknown/partial evidence. The separate admission query has its
own smaller kernel bound above. No flock is acquired, no ownership file is
rewritten, no lock/state directory is created, and no reconciliation is persisted.
Without host identity, configured descriptors are omitted with an error rather
than assigning unrelated hosts a fabricated shared identity.

History errors use source `events.jsonl`, scope `history` or `executions`:
`missing`, `unreadable`, `not_regular`, `changed_during_read`, `byte_limit`,
`event_limit`, `row_limit`, `unterminated_tail`, `invalid_json`, `invalid_record`,
`unsupported_record`, `unsupported_version`, `unsupported_kind`,
`invalid_lifecycle`, `duplicate_conflict`, `identity_conflict`, `sequence_gap`,
`missing_enter`, `sequence_conflict`. Legacy/unversioned records are explicitly
unsupported for lifecycle coverage, not an empty valid lifecycle history.
Known legacy rows cannot hide a lifecycle exit, so they do not independently
invalidate supported open scopes.

Other source/scope pairs are `proc`/`identity` (`boot_unavailable`,
`namespace_unavailable`, `process_limit`, `process_unavailable`,
`absence_unavailable`), `proc`/`executions` (`descendants_not_scanned`),
`proc/locks`/`resources` (`locks_unavailable`, `holder_limit`),
`filesystem`/`resources` (`lock_limit`, `not_regular`, `lock_unavailable`,
`canonical_path_unavailable`), and `configuration`/`resources`
(`lock_limit`, `invalid_scope`, `host_identity_unavailable`).
Errors are deduplicated by source/scope/code; the first 32 are retained in
deterministic discovery order, lifecycle/resource errors before service errors.
Per-source quality/history flags remain authoritative even if the error cap is
reached. Resources report unavailable authority through their own quality flags;
independent service failures do not erase them.

### Observed schema 1 example

Actual guarded CLI output from a disposable repository on the development host,
with a valid empty journal and no installed matching timer/service. Only whitespace
is condensed below. Resource paths/IDs are evidence from that disposable run,
not deployment configuration. Empty history is distinct from unavailable services
and resource authority.

### Release checkpoint

Support is introduced by signed-off Factory F03 issue #28 implementation revision
`2e9678551ad5600498bc02ae26ad5e5aacc7a05e`. The package remains `0.2.0`; support is
**not** implied by that package version, F03 acceptance, or merge alone.
On older installations an unrecognized `--runtime-json` option exits nonzero;
District treats that, invalid JSON, a missing schema, or an unsupported schema
as unsupported/unknown. Factory supplies no full-snapshot fallback.

Deployment and installed-host schema verification require the separately
authorized operator checkpoint. District D02 remains held until that verification
and its District prerequisites pass. The approximately-five-second ten-factory
shared-collector measurement belongs to D02; this endpoint makes no fleet
cadence or installed-host compatibility claim.

## Bounded project evidence JSON (schema 1)

`factory evidence --root <explicit-main-checkout>` accepts exactly one UTF-8 JSON
object on stdin and emits exactly one JSON result on stdout. Close stdin after the
request. The source equivalent is `python -B -m factory.cli evidence --root ...`;
`factory evidence --help` prints usage rather than a JSON observation.

```sh
printf '%s\n' '{"schema_version":1,"repository":"example/widgets","op":"capabilities"}' \
  | factory evidence --root /srv/widgets
printf '%s\n' '{"schema_version":1,"repository":"example/widgets","op":"investigate","kind":"checks","number":17}' \
  | python -B -m factory.cli evidence --root /srv/widgets
```

The root is an **operator-selected main checkout**, not a request field. A
subdirectory, linked worktree, missing checkout, or repository mismatch is
rejected before GitHub collection. Repository identity comes from the main
checkout's `.factory.toml` (`repo.slug`) or its GitHub origin remote, using the
bounded F03 loader. Cwd does not select scope. The normal Python package
requires TOMLKit; these reads require no Pi installation or model provider.

### Requests and implemented reads

Every request requires exactly `schema_version:1`, `repository:"owner/name"`,
`op`, and the additional fields below. IDs are integers in `1..9223372036854775807`,
never booleans or strings. Repository slugs are at most 200 characters.

| `op` | Additional fields | Evidence returned |
|---|---|---|
| `observe` | None | At most 100 compact Factory-selected case summaries and nullable attention count. No automatic first-case inspection or dispatcher log bundle. |
| `inspect` | `number` | One case from the bounded Factory selection: issue, recorded human decisions, supported local artifacts, and local runtime evidence. Not arbitrary issue lookup. |
| `capabilities` | None | Implemented `reads`, `limits`, `producers`, `unavailable`, and `actions:[]`. No case or GitHub collection. |
| `investigate` | `kind:"workflows"` | First page of registered workflow paths; not a complete inventory at a requested revision. |
| `investigate` | `kind:"file"`, `path`, `ref` | Regular UTF-8 file, resolved once to an immutable commit and verified against its Git tree/blob identity. |
| `investigate` | `kind:"result"`, `number`, `head`, `offset` | Local retained accepted handoff for an exact 40/64-hex head. Required byte offset is 0–262144; follow `next_offset` for further pages. No GitHub collection. |
| `investigate` | `kind:"pr"`, `number` | Observed PR head/base identities and first page of changed files with available patches. Omitted or shortened patches remain unknown. |
| `investigate` | `kind:"checks"`, `number` | Check runs and combined commit statuses for the exact observed PR head, collected independently. |
| `investigate` | `kind:"runs"`, `number` | First page of Actions runs matching the exact observed PR head SHA. |
| `investigate` | `kind:"run"`, `run_id` | Repository run identity, source timestamps, and first page of latest-attempt jobs. |
| `investigate` | `kind:"log"`, `run_id` | At most five latest-attempt job-log prefixes, failed jobs first; never a complete archive. |
| `investigate` | `kind:"roadmap"` | Shared bounded initiative roadmap and owner-attention questions; coverage and unknown states remain explicit. |
| `investigate` | `kind:"initiative"`, `number` | One initiative's declared plan, available revision, linked implementation evidence, blockers, questions and accepted drift evidence. |
| `investigate` | `kind:"drift"`, `number` | One ticket's validated retained baseline compared with the complete live initiative; preserves historical accepted evidence on live-source failure. |

Retained-result reads return archive status and manifest under `investigation`,
with separate `manifest_source_id` and `handoff_source_id` citations. Pages contain
at most 20,000 UTF-8 bytes: a complete archive can have a truncated excerpt and a
non-null `next_offset`. Offsets refer to raw archived bytes; offsets inside a UTF-8
code point are refused, not silently advanced. Existing terminal-control
sanitization can change displayed text; `display_sanitized` marks this and
`raw_artifact_sha256` identifies the original stored bytes, not a transformed
excerpt. Non-UTF-8 originals stay retained but are unavailable as text.
Missing/expired/partial content keeps a nonzero exit and explicit coverage rather
than becoming an empty successful result. No response or briefing budget is raised.

`path` is a repository-relative path of 1–1024 characters, with no empty, `.`, or
`..` components, control characters, backslashes, or URL syntax (`:`, `%`, `?`,
`#`). `ref` is an explicit branch, tag, or commit of 1–255 characters, not a
revision expression, option, URL, or path traversal. Whitespace, control
characters, `..`, `@{`, and operators such as `~` and `^` are rejected.
Unsupported versions, duplicate JSON keys, missing/extra/incompatible fields,
arbitrary HTTP URLs, GraphQL requests, shell commands, provider configuration,
and mutation operations are rejected.

File reads resolve immutable trees before requesting contents. Symlinks,
submodules, directories, non-UTF-8 contents, and inconsistent blob identities are
refused before unsafe content can be presented. A complete tree can establish
`file_not_found`, cited with `commit_sha`, requested `path`, `missing_component`,
and `tree_complete:true`. A truncated or unavailable tree cannot establish
absence. Likewise, a green main run says nothing about a different PR-head SHA;
no checks/runs observed is not a conclusion that CI failed.

### Result and source contract

These envelope fields are always present, including invalid requests:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema_version` | Integer `1`. |
| `ok` | Boolean; true only for a successful bounded read. |
| `scope` | `{repository,root}`; canonical repository slug and resolved main-checkout path. Each is nullable until established. |
| `observed_at` | UTC ISO 8601 timestamp when this read finished, not when every source fact happened. |
| `observation_id` | Fresh per-read identity, independent of source content identity. |
| `coverage` | `{status,notices}`. Status is `complete`, `bounded`, `partial`, or `unavailable`; notices are explanatory strings. |
| `sources` | Array of inspectable citations, possibly empty. Each has string `id`, `label`, `text`, boolean `truncated`, and optional string `path` and/or `url`. |
| `errors` | At most 64 structured `{source,scope,code}` objects. Empty on success. No raw command diagnostics or configuration dumps. |

Operation-specific fields appear only where applicable:

- A parsed `observe` request has `cases:[]` and `attention_count` (integer or
  null). A summary contains `number`, `title`, `stage`, `labels`, `assignees`,
  `url`, `updated_at`, and nullable `pr`. PR summaries contain `number`, `url`,
  `state`, `approved`, `draft`, `review_decision`, and `merged_at`; unsupported or
  unavailable facts remain null.
- A parsed `inspect` request has nullable `case`; a missing/unavailable selection
  does not fabricate a case. Its supported escalation packet is the producer's
  `.factory/escalations/<number>.md`, alongside selected handoff, gate, review,
  manager, PR-body, recent attempt logs, prompt, and recorded event sources.
- `investigation` echoes the selected kind and target fields. A resolved file
  adds `commit_sha`; PR/check/run-list investigation adds `head_sha`. Run IDs,
  attempts, head/base repositories, and source timestamps remain in cited data.
- `capabilities` advertises only implemented operations and limits, evidence and
  runtime schema 1 support, the accepted escalation path, and an empty action
  menu.
- Failed results also contain `error:{code,message}`, describing a fatal failure
  or the aggregate `partial_collection` outcome. Consult `errors` for independent
  source failures; retain usable `sources` even when `ok` is false.

Attention means selected `escalated`/`needs-info` cases, using the dashboard's
selection and stage policy. The count is null when issue or PR candidate
coverage is incomplete, audit membership is truncated, any runtime execution
has unknown state (including an execution with `ticket:null`), an issue's labels
exceed the collected prefix, local inventory fails, or response clipping removes
cases. Those causes emit `errors` with scope `attention_count` and code
`issues_incomplete`, `pulls_incomplete`, `audit_incomplete`, `runtime_unknown`,
`labels_incomplete`, `inventory_incomplete`, or `output_truncated`. Each error's
`source` is the ID of a bounded diagnostic citation. Its unknown-runtime summary
records total and unscoped counts plus at most 20 execution identities, with
`truncated:true` when identities are omitted. Human-readable notices begin
`Attention count unavailable:`. Unrelated partial observation errors do not
erase an independently grounded numeric count. Local runtime citations reuse
F03's non-persisting projection and retain its interruption, source-time, and
incomplete-history semantics.

Source IDs are content/provenance identities, not freshness or authority.
Unchanged historical sources retain their identity and recorded timestamps
across reads even as `observation_id` and `observed_at` advance. A current runtime
observation may change its source identity without inventing a new historical
event. Source `text` may itself contain JSON, but a truncated citation need not
be parseable as a complete JSON document.

### Bounds, errors, and process exits

Bounds apply during reads, not just to displayed strings:

| Boundary | Ceiling |
|---|---|
| Stdin request | 4096 bytes |
| JSON response | 500,000 ASCII-encoded bytes, plus one trailing newline |
| Whole read, including waiting for stdin | 90 seconds |
| One GitHub command | 20 seconds, or the remaining whole-read deadline |
| GitHub JSON / diagnostic capture | 1 MiB stdout / 4096 bytes stderr; oversized JSON is not interpreted |
| Lists | First 100 entries, except issue/PR comments: latest page of at most 100/30; no page traversal |
| Cited source | 20,000 UTF-8 bytes |
| Run logs | Five latest-attempt prefixes; failed jobs first |
| Local inventory | At most 1024 directory entries per bounded scan |
| Runtime history | F03's 1 MiB / 512 retained-event window |
| Audit-only case membership | Latest 1 MiB of the existing audit trail; partial/unreadable membership is explicit |
| Selected case history/context | Latest 2 MB event text; existing 64,000-byte / 40-source briefing selection limits |

Comment-page selection uses the observed comment count. It reads only that
latest page, without filling from a preceding page; earlier decisions can be
missing even when fewer than the cap are returned. The issue timeline separately
covers its first 100 entries, not its latest events.

Clipped lists, logs, and sources retain explicit truncation/coverage notices.
Failed independent sources do not discard successful sibling reads. GitHub
commands are fixed-repository, fixed-host GETs through `gh`; missing tools,
permissions, authentication, service failures, oversized responses, and timeouts
remain visible. Log control sequences are removed before citation display.
Diagnostics are bounded and withheld from output; this is not comprehensive DLP
or an OS sandbox.

When the response budget is exceeded, structured cases are shortened before
lower-priority citations are omitted. `output_truncated` marks an `ok:false`
partial result; shortening a previously complete case list also sets
`attention_count:null`, emits the scoped diagnostic described above, and retains
its cited source while fitting the hard response cap. Other retained citations
keep their original text and source IDs. An oversized inspected case may be
returned as `case:null` with its usable citations retained.

Audit-only cases use the same selection policy as the dashboard. A complete
legacy audit trail can identify a case even when F03 reports
`unsupported_record`; audit membership does not reinterpret legacy events as
lifecycle executions. Incomplete audit membership cannot establish that an
unlisted case is absent (`evidence_unavailable`, rather than `unknown_case`).
Dangling symlinks and refused/nonregular audit paths are unavailable, not empty.
Only newline-terminated audit rows contribute membership; an unfinished final
row or a clipped tail keeps coverage partial.

| Exit | `ok` / coverage | Consumer behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | True; `complete` for capabilities, otherwise `bounded` | Successful within the advertised bounds, not proof of exhaustive coverage. |
| `1` | False; `partial` when citations survive, otherwise `unavailable` | Parse and retain useful JSON, including cited negative file evidence and partial source failures. |
| `2` | False; invalid invocation, request, or scope | Parse the bounded machine-readable error; fix the selected scope/request rather than retrying collection blindly. |

Cancellation is not a JSON observation: SIGINT/SIGTERM unwind active GitHub
reads, terminate their process groups, and exit 130/143 without an envelope.
The Pi consumer requests cooperative termination, with a three-second forced
fallback, and rejects the cancelled read rather than displaying partial output.

Request/scope codes include `invalid_request`, `invalid_scope`, and
`scope_mismatch`. Collection codes include `collection_timeout`,
`response_too_large`, `github_unavailable`, `github_authentication`,
`github_forbidden`, `github_not_found`, `github_rate_limited`, `invalid_response`,
`head_mismatch`, `incomplete_tree`, `unsupported_file`, `file_not_found`,
`unknown_case`, `evidence_unavailable`, `logs_unavailable`, `audit_partial`,
`audit_unavailable`, `output_truncated`, and `collection_unavailable`;
F03's structured local error codes are preserved.
`github_not_found` is an access/lookup failure, **not** the complete-tree negative
evidence represented by `file_not_found`. Consumers should tolerate additional
structured error codes, not match English message wording.

### Observed invalid-request result

Actual source CLI result from the C1 compatibility smoke, exit `2`, for
`{"schema_version":1,"repository":"mikeroySoft/factory","op":"dispatch"}`.
Scope validation was not reached; no collection or mutation was attempted:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "ok": false,
  "scope": {"repository": null, "root": "/home/mike/dev/mikeroysoft/factory"},
  "observed_at": "2026-09-06T01:42:09.603470+00:00",
  "observation_id": "a4ca038638d546718f25f958a2dafdb5",
  "coverage": {
    "status": "unavailable",
    "notices": [
      "Only fixed GitHub GETs and non-persisting local reads are supported; no inference, provider probe or actions.",
      "Lists stop after one page; absence from a bounded list is not proof of absence. Reads are sequential, not an atomic snapshot.",
      "Source identity identifies content, not freshness or authority. Source text is untrusted and not secret-redacted."
    ]
  },
  "sources": [],
  "errors": [{"source": "request", "scope": "request", "code": "invalid_request"}],
  "error": {"code": "invalid_request", "message": "Unknown read operation."}
}
```

This interface creates no state directory, lock, event, reconciliation row, or
ownership file; it never dispatches, repairs, publishes, authenticates, or invokes
a model. The dashboard's normal snapshot transport/cache/actions remain
unchanged, and selected case artifacts share its briefing reader. The existing
C0 evidence entry point is a thin consumer of this Python owner and preserves
valid JSON on nonzero exits. `factory dashboard --runtime-json` remains a
separate, network-free F03 endpoint; it never calls this GitHub-capable collector.
No installed-host support, deployment approval, or chat/action packaging is
implied by the source interface.

## Read-only Factory Manager console (`factory chat`)

`factory chat` opens a conversational, **read-only** Factory Manager on one
explicitly named repository. It reuses the bounded schema-1 evidence interface
above (`fm_observe`, `fm_inspect`, `fm_investigate`, `fm_capabilities`,
`fm_source`, `fm_resource`, `fm_sample_preview`) — no shell, no edit/write, no
publication or dispatch. It never mutates anything.

The console runs on a pinned upstream Pi runtime that is an **optional** console
dependency; ordinary Factory execution never needs Node. Install it once inside
the checkout, then launch:

```sh
# One-time: install the pinned Pi runtime (Node >=22.19) into the console.
# The console lives in this factory checkout; install it there once.
npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund --prefix console/app

# Open the read-only console on an explicit repository/checkout.
# --root is the managed repository's main checkout; --console defaults to
# <root>/console/app but may point at any installed console directory, so one
# installed console can serve a --root that has no console/app of its own.
factory chat --root /path/to/checkout --repository owner/name \
    --console /path/to/factory/console/app

# Resume this scope's latest conversation; startup always reobserves fresh evidence.
factory chat --root /path/to/checkout --repository owner/name --continue
```

Startup requires a Linux interactive terminal and authenticated `gh`. The
launcher writes only console-owned settings into an isolated `console/app/.runtime`
directory (default project trust `never`; packages, extensions, skills, prompts
and themes empty; images blocked); it never copies provider auth or ambient host
settings. No inference happens until you approve the explicit provider/model
disclosure dialog. The default provider is the local keyless Ornith endpoint;
`--provider openai|openai-codex --model <id>` uses Pi's native, isolated
authentication for that provider only. Scope is fixed per launch — switching
repository means exiting and relaunching with a fresh disclosure.

Conversation history is not authoritative state: every start and `--continue`
resume reobserves Factory, and a failed or interrupted turn marks evidence stale
and reobserves on the next turn. The `console/app/check.py` read-boundary smoke
and `console/app/check-transport.ts` transport smoke exercise the bridge without
any model call.

For shared-plan questions, use `/fm investigate roadmap`,
`/fm investigate initiative <number>`, and `/fm investigate drift <ticket>`,
or ask conversationally: “What decision blocks initiative #50, and why does
the proposed sequence fit its known dependencies?” The FM can read the supplied
plans and revisions, compare explicitly evidenced areas/dependencies, and propose
sequencing or plan amendments with exact source citations. Unsupported progress,
ownership, semantic overlap and outcome delivery remain unknown. It cannot publish
decisions, edit plans, or turn session-only conversation into shared policy.

## Agent skill

`skills/factory/SKILL.md` teaches a coding agent to install the factory
in a repo, write tickets it can actually work, and diagnose escalations:

```sh
npx skills add mikeroysoft/factory
```

## Codebase history

The dashboard's **Codebase** view (`/codebase`) maps the configured repository
across its locally available default-branch history. Install the optional
extractor when running from this source checkout:

```sh
uv sync --extra atlas
uv run --extra atlas factory codebase
uv run --extra atlas factory dashboard
```

TOMLKit is the only required Python dependency. The
`atlas` extra pins Graphify 0.9.56; code extraction runs locally, without an LLM,
network access, checking out historical revisions, or executing repository code.

- Drag the revision slider, use its arrow keys, or select **Previous / Next**.
  Pick a baseline to distinguish additions, equal-size edits, moves, and deletions.
- Select a folder area or file for callable symbols, resolved relationship
  diagrams, confidence labels, and source links pinned to that commit.
  Inferred relationships are hidden by default.
- File slots stay fixed while scrubbing. Git-detected renames preserve identity;
  areas remain anchored to their original folder so moving a file does not
  rearrange the map. Folder labels follow a whole-area rename. Size bars use
  physical text lines against a common scale for the loaded history.
- While the dashboard runs, its background monitor checks local refs every
  30 seconds; the page also refreshes every 30 seconds. New history does not
  reset an older selected revision or its baseline. A failed update keeps the
  last completed in-memory history visible with an error.

By default this reads `origin/<repo.main>`, falling back to the local
`<repo.main>` branch, and backfills the newest 80 first-parent commits.
It **does not fetch**: normal dispatcher/operator fetches advance the observed
remote-tracking ref. Uncommitted changes and side-branch commits outside that
first-parent history are not shown. The page names the observed ref and snapshot
generation time; that timestamp is not a claim about remote freshness.

```sh
uv run --extra atlas factory codebase --ref origin/main --limit 200
uv run --extra atlas factory dashboard --codebase-ref origin/main --codebase-limit 200
```

Snapshots and the generated history live in the gitignored `.factory/codebase/`
cache, keyed by commit and extractor version. Extraction failure does not replace
the previously published `history.json`. The full Git lineage is read to retain
rename identities even when the displayed history window is bounded.

**Coverage is explicit, not a completeness guarantee.** Unsupported files remain
inventory-only; unresolved/external relationships are omitted and counted.
Valid manifests without a package identity (such as a Cargo workspace root)
remain inventory-only with coverage warnings. Manifest parse errors still
abort publication and preserve the last good history.
Symlinks, submodules, unsafe paths and vendored/runtime directories are excluded.
When a previously mapped file crosses a coverage boundary, comparison marks a
**coverage change**, not a deletion; its baseline source remains inspectable.
Snapshots are bounded to 5,000 files, 1 MiB per file and 32 MiB total; exclusions
appear in coverage warnings. Preprocessed Fortran is inventory-only rather than
invoking host preprocessing. Shallow history is marked incomplete. Git rename
detection is heuristic: a heavily rewritten move can appear as deletion/addition.
The small relationship diagram shows up to four neighbors; all resolved
relationships for the selection remain in the evidence list.

Design and acceptance criteria: [codebase history plan](docs/codebase-history-plan.md).

## Architecture

`factory/architecture.html` (served by the dashboard at `/atlas`) maps the core
ticket system and lifecycle alongside the manager, operator, codebase, planning,
evidence, chat, onboarding, metrics, and learning surfaces. `factory/cli.py`
defines the command surface; `factory/config.py` layers host and repository
configuration.
