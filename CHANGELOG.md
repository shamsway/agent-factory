# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Bounded worker boot/resume context (#89): `factory dispatch`'s worker prompt gets a `## Resume context` section, built only from the latest retained accepted result (#88) and the local plan-bound journal (#57), when a ticket has prior retained history. It reports the prior accepted head/result and whether the admitted scope has since moved (`unchanged`/`changed`/`unavailable`); never a worker log, prompt, or transcript, never a scope rewrite, and no widened context budgets.

## 0.3.5 — 2026-09-18

Compared against 0.3.0 (`289cac5`). Released channel `stable` points at `v0.3.5`.

- Retain independently accepted worker handoffs outside worktrees (#88): exact-head provenance and integrity, 90-day content/365-day metadata, 256 KiB artifact/1 MiB bundle/256 MiB repository limits, explicit incomplete/privacy/expiry states, and fail-closed cleanup when retention fails. Add local paged `kind: result` evidence reads and console/briefing consumption without widening context budgets, transcript ingestion, or execution authority. (PR #113)
- External pull-request review lane (#5–#9): discover open, non-draft PRs opted in by `needs-review` or a review request, preserve that opt-in after viability verdicts, publish cited reviews bound to the recorded head, re-review changed heads within bounded rounds, record fail-closed required-CI readiness, and surface the six-state Ops queue plus actionable Inbox rows. The lane never edits or pushes contributor branches and never merges their PRs. Viability replay remains keyed to the label-add event, not the PR head.
- Bundle Cyberpunk, GPUFlo, District, Factory, ROCm, Porcelain, Sandstone, Slate and Forest dashboard themes with a persistent browser-local picker, preserving configured repository CSS as the default. Keep the title/status row above the consistent navigation row in a shared sticky header. Open Ops at the root without automatic FM briefing requests; explicit Inbox and existing deep links remain available. (PR #110)
- Add dashboard Settings for exactly five repository controls: concurrent tickets, time limit per ticket, worker/gate attempts, reviewer revision rounds, and Factory Manager model. Show effective values and sources, require an explicit reviewed save, reject stale writes, preserve unrelated TOML comments, and keep changes local and uncommitted. TOMLKit is the sole required Python dependency on current `main`; it is loaded only by settings write helpers. (PR #111)
- Shared roadmap and owner attention (#58): dashboard and read-only FM consume the same initiative/routing/drift producers. Owner/team filters select questions without changing canonical plans or granting authority; source failures, unknown ownership, missing baselines and assigned-but-non-runnable human takeover stay explicit. C1 adds roadmap, initiative and retained-drift reads with citations; declared stage and implementation closure never prove owner-confirmed delivery. Complete-content revision identity and historical accepted evidence remain intact. No publication, intake release, deployment or live two-human acceptance is implied.
- Immutable initiative bindings (#57): linked tickets carry a schema-1 baseline of the complete initiative's normalized Outcome, Boundaries, Plan, and Success evidence; admission pins the full human-approved ticket snapshot for every retry and fails closed on malformed, changed, incomplete, or unavailable sources while legacy unlinked tickets remain unchanged. Read-only `factory plan baseline` and `factory plan drift` expose proposals and accepted-versus-live drift without mutation or inferred attribution. Manager `REWRITE` preserves the exact accepted binding, and `SPLIT` preflights the live source and every child before creating intake-ready work; models cannot rebaseline.
- Correct routed-handoff integration (#56): neutralize incidental mentions in explanations while preserving validated destinations; journal manager `CLOSE` comment receipts on the correct PR/issue timeline; attempt terminal handoffs even when an earlier manager phase fails without hiding that error or allowing new scheduling. Refresh the architecture atlas with the handoff phase and current manager/dispatch citations.
- Preserve human takeover after a failed escalation comment: without the current escalation's recorded comment, the manager fails closed and leaves routing to the human handoff pass. Later handoff receipts cannot authorize recovery or hide human unassignments. (#56)
- Routed human handoffs (#56): once automatic recovery for an escalation is terminal (manager `HUMAN`, manager command failure as an explicit unable-to-diagnose, `manager.rounds` exhausted, no manager, or an escalation the loop can never act on again: unapplied decision, missing packet, unreceipted escalation comment), `factory manage` publishes one public-safe request per escalation generation with the question, bounded evidence links, proposed next step and the `factory plan route` owner/candidates and rationale; mentions only on the initial handoff and on an actual owner change, never assigning anyone. Intent and comment id are journaled (`handoff`, `comment` rows); a crash or failed `gh` between them is reconciled from the timeline before any retry, a failed lookup posts nothing, and `--dry-run` journals nothing. Human-takeover checks now trust only recorded comment ids (escalation, manager and handoff comments), never text prefixes; an edited recorded comment is human activity. Upgrade note: the first pass publishes a request for every open `ready-for-human` ticket whose escalation is already terminal, including pre-#56 escalations (their comments carry no receipt, so the manager no longer runs on them).
- Manager PR frontier (#15): `factory manage` observes every factory-owned `agent/<n>` PR through the schema-1 feedback producer (#79) and escalates once on red CI, undelivered current-head feedback, or `manager.stale_days` inactivity; late feedback is delivered at most once per `(evidence_id, source_revision)` and never from partial coverage or unverified ownership. New manager `CLOSE` decision closes the PR and proposes `wontfix-proposal` on a human issue (closes a factory-created child); `wontfix-proposal` is now a provisioned label. `manager.review = "all"` is implemented: the `factory-approved` label waits for a manager `APPROVE` bound to the exact head, never re-bound across a refresh. `pr-opened` journal rows carry the PR number; `SPLIT` records `issue-created`.
- The `initiative` label is now an unconditional execution guard, read fresh at each owning boundary: triage refuses before any model call, `factory dispatch` (including `--ticket`) refuses to claim, the manager refuses viability and escalation handling, and the merge stage refuses an `agent/<n>` PR whose ticket is an initiative. Refusals are logged, visible in `--dry-run`, and mutate nothing. Ordinary tickets are unchanged. (#55)
- Initiative issue template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/initiative.md`, label `initiative` only) installed by `factory init`; the `initiative` label is provisioned with the others. Read-only `factory plan list` / `factory plan inspect N` emit schema 1 JSON: declared status/owner, sections, implementation links and linked-issue state, with partial/malformed results explicit. Reading an initiative grants no execution authority; #55 now enforces the initiative execution guard at every owning boundary. (#53)
- `factory plan route N --reason <requirements|implementation|ci|unknown> [--path P]... --json` and the optional `[collaboration]` section (`fallback`, `reasons.<reason>`, `components."<exact path prefix>"`) resolve the human decision owner of a ticket read-only, with status (`selected`/`candidates`/`unassigned`/`invalid`), source revision and step-by-step provenance. A `**Decision owner**` ticket section is a human override; `@org/team` is rejected on user-owned repositories; no section means unchanged behaviour. (#54)
- Distinguish missing optional routing owners from invalid declarations, bound overrides to their own sections, retain rejected mixed-destination provenance without selecting a survivor, and reject dead reason mappings and duplicate normalized component prefixes. Preserve coverage notices on invalid invocations. (#54)
- Add `factory chat`: a supported, read-only Factory Manager console over the pinned upstream Pi runtime (`console/app`) and the schema-1 evidence interface. Seven bounded evidence tools, no shell/edit/write/dispatch, isolated console-owned settings and provider auth, and an explicit provider/model disclosure gate before any inference. Every start and `--continue` resume reobserves fresh evidence rather than trusting stale conversation. Node/Pi stays an optional console dependency (`npm ci --ignore-scripts --prefix console/app`); ordinary Factory execution never needs it. (#86)
- Add dashboard `/chat`: the selected three-column Factory Manager layout with live repository-wide/case/run evidence, citation inspection, truthful request activity, Motion-powered reflowing context panels, and browser-local conversation history. The page remains read-only and uses the existing bounded `/api/ask` transport.
- Add schema-1 source-versioned PR feedback at full dashboard `tickets[].pr.feedback`, shared by Review, Inbox and briefing. Retain simultaneous native review/thread/check evidence and provenance-backed Factory reviews with deterministic identities, explicit unknown/partial coverage, fixed 100-item/two-page/20 KB-body/32-error/30-second bounds, and head-race handling. Reviews carry the provider's own `updatedAt`, so an edited review revises its source revision. Detail reads run only for open PRs; closed and merged PRs keep the schema-1 envelope with `not_collected` sources, which is unknown rather than empty or unsupported. Read-only: no feedback delivery, readiness or merge authority; runtime JSON is unchanged. (#79)
- Add optional Codebase history: stable commit-timeline maps, baseline comparisons, confidence-aware relationships, pinned source citations, and bounded background refresh through `factory[atlas]`. (#67)
- Add opt-in direction viability to `factory manage`: `needs-review` PRs before `needs-viability` issues, evidence-cited BUILD/DONT_BUILD/DEFER comments, and label-event replay protection. Only issue BUILD enters `needs-triage`; PRs remain recommendation-only, with no review or handoff mechanics.
- Fix manager prompt transport to use files, including `factory learn`; validate manager commands in doctor, bound nonzero-exit diagnostics, and count manager failures separately from escalation totals and rounds without overriding human takeover. (#62)
- Recognize District's `[defaults.engine]` snapshot metadata in `factory doctor` without loading it as pipeline configuration; keep warnings for unknown and misplaced host tables.
- Keep generated services on the installed Factory snapshot even when their repository working directory contains a shadowing `factory` package. (#70)
- Add optional, host-owned `[install].python` selection for every generated service command (unset uses `sys.executable`), preserving symlink identity and `-P`. Pre-mutation validation reads and parses `systemctl --user show-environment`, applies the unit PATH and overlays `[install].env`, reports the loaded version, and checks all service module origins with selected `purelib`/`platlib` context for lexical checkout shadows outside selected package roots. Render the interpreter as one literal systemd argument, rejecting control characters and escaping backslash, quote, `$` and `%`. No environment provisioning or version matching; `--print` remains rendering-only. (#1)
- Preserve package-less manifest inventory when Graphify labels valid empty output as a failed source; retain fatal parse errors and last-good history. (#72)
- Bind gate, reviewer, durable approval, CI, and merge eligibility to one immutable PR head; fail closed on reviewer process/verdict errors and raced heads or vetoes, re-review refreshed branches, and pin merges with `--match-head-commit`. Legacy unbound approvals are withdrawn for re-earning through manager FIX.
- Create PRs against the configured integration branch explicitly and reject approval/merge eligibility for missing, wrong, or changed targets. Existing wrong-target PRs are not retargeted. Document explicit `@stable` and `@main` installation channels now that the GitHub default is `main`.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-08

Compared against 0.2.0 (`f9122cd`). Installed fleet-wide through District at `9478e9d`.

### Manager stage (inert until `[manager].command` is configured)

- `factory manage`: resolves untouched `ready-for-human` escalation packets with a closed, code-applied decision menu — `RETRY`, `REWRITE`, `SPLIT`, `ROUTE`, `HUMAN`. Malformed output is `HUMAN`. A `manage` event is recorded before any GitHub mutation; a failed mutation leaves the ticket with the human, records a lifecycle `mechanism_failure`, and is never replayed. (#13)
- `[manager]` config table: `command`, `rounds`, `review = "escalated" | "all"`; legacy string commands are parsed with `shlex`. `factory doctor` reports the manager only when configured. (#12)
- Manager notes: `.factory/manager/notes.md` read into every manager prompt, with write-back and consolidation. (#14)
- `factory learn` runs through the manager when configured and opens a `chore` PR carrying only `.factory-lessons.md`; unchanged without `[manager]`. (#16)
- `CURATE` decision, accepted only from `factory learn`: proposes `AGENTS.md` / `.omp/skills/**` / `CONTRIBUTING.md` changes as a `chore` PR; verification paths are never touched. (#18)
- `[defaults.manager]` caps (`max_active_cap`, `budget_min_cap`) for District's fleet-level manager pass. (#21)
- Structured escalation packets written by `escalate()` to `.factory/escalations/<n>.md`: reason, attempt table, gate/review evidence, kept worktree. (#11)

### Review stage

- Reviewer contract grounds every blocking finding in an acceptance criterion, a documented rule with its source, or a concrete correctness/security defect with trigger and impact. Required fixes are separated from optional suggestions; `REVISE` only while required fixes remain. Net-new abstractions beyond the brief need justification; missing justification alone does not block. A passing gate does not excuse a defect it did not detect. (#36)
- Reviewer defaults to `omp` with `anthropic/claude-fable-5-1`.

### Merge stage

- **Fix:** `refresh_pr_branch` erased a PR whose `agent/<n>` branch had no local copy — it started the branch from `main`, gated an empty tree, and force-pushed it; GitHub then auto-closed the PR. Refresh now starts from `origin/agent/<n>`, refuses to push a head with nothing ahead of `main`, and pulls such a PR from merge candidacy so it escalates once rather than starving the queue. (#49)
- **Fix:** upstream-sync PRs were squashed once upstream moved past the PR's tip, dropping the ancestry the sync exists to preserve. Merge method is now judged by the PR's merge-base with upstream, not upstream's current tip; sync PRs merge `main` in rather than rebase. (#41)

### Workers

- `[workers.<name>].when` rules route tickets by label/state; `ci-fix` and `conflict` default profiles. (#20)
- Per-ticket brief at claim time: `.factory/brief-<n>.md` from `git log -S`/grep of ticket nouns, recent PRs touching those files, the triage brief, and matching lessons — deterministic, token-capped, appended to the worker prompt. (#17)

### Runtime evidence and observability

- F01: authoritative execution lifecycle journal — `enter`/`exit`, child processes, handoffs, outcomes and reasons — per stage, in `.factory/events.jsonl`. (#26)
- F02: known waits and evidenced lock ownership; `ticket_lock_contended`, `merge_lock_contended`, `ci_pending` and similar are recorded, not inferred. (#27)
- F03: `factory dashboard --runtime-json` — bounded schema 1 runtime projection from local read-only evidence only; partial source failures stay structured. (#28)
- Bounded read-only FM evidence interface with a Pi consumer; grounded full decision briefings and contextual FM questions. (#25, #38)
- Runtime quality graded independently of history-window completeness; journal read once per full snapshot. (#43)

### Stats and dashboard

- Human-touch metrics: escalation count, resolver attribution (human/factory/unknown), minutes in `ready-for-human`, re-queues; `escalations_per_week` and `human_resolved_pct` in `--json` and the dashboard KPI row. (#10)
- Per-label pass rates in `factory stats`. (#19)
- Dashboard and site adopt the mikeroySoft design system; sage product theme.

### Install and onboarding

- `factory install` runs triage before dispatch in the unit, jitters timers, and serialises triage on the host lock; restarts only units that existed and changed.
- `factory init` writes `.github/workflows/ci.yml` when the repo has no workflow; `doctor` warns on a missing or placeholder workflow.
- Repository adopted under District; `agent-factory` renamed to `factory`.

### Known limitations

- The manager stage runs an arbitrary configured executable; configure the agent CLI in read-only/no-tools mode. Factory instructs it not to edit files but does not sandbox it.
- A stale *local* `agent/<n>` (behind the remote after another host advanced it) can still win in `ensure_worktree`; `--force-with-lease` does not protect because the refresh fetches first. Only relevant with a second dispatcher host. Tracked on #49.
- `cargo` has no minimum-release-age control; crates.io installs are unguarded by District's package-age policy.
